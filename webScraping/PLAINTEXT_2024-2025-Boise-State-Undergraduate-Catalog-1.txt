This catalog is primarily for and directed at students. However, it serves many audiences, such as high school counselors, academic advisors, and the public. In this catalog you will find an overview of Boise State University and information on admission, registration, grades, tuition and fees, financial aid, housing, student services, and other important policies and procedures. However, most of this catalog is devoted to describing the various programs and courses offered at Boise State.
Choosing an academic program of study that fits your interests is likely one of your primary concerns. To be successful, you will need to understand the requirements for the degree or certificate you decide to pursue. Chapter 10 is a good place to start. This chapter explains the various types of degrees and certificates, the general requirements associated with each type, and other policies and procedures applicable to all degrees. This chapter also describes how to read the table of requirements for your chosen program.
Next, Chapter 11 will help you find information about specific programs and course offerings. It lists every undergraduate program of study offered at Boise State, which unit administers the program, and on what page its specific requirements are listed. This chapter also lists the course prefixes and their meanings.
Finally, Chapter 12 describes all the undergraduate academic programs and course offerings. Within the chapter, programs are listed alphabetically and are appropriately cross-referenced.
Even though we attempted to make this catalog as comprehensive as possible, you still might have questions. For inquiries regarding your academic program, contact your advisor (or the Advising and Academic Support Center (AASC), if you have not chosen a major). For other questions contact the offices listed in the appropriate chapters.

Policy Statement Concerning Catalog Contents
The purpose of the Boise State Catalog is to provide current, articulate and accurate information about Boise State University for guidance of prospective students, for faculty and administrative officers, for students currently enrolled, and for other education or allied agencies.
Catalogs, bulletins, course and fee schedules, etc., are not to be considered as binding contracts between Boise State University and students. The university and its divisions reserve the right at any time, without advance notice, to: (a) withdraw or cancel classes, courses, and programs; (b) change fee schedules; (c) change the academic calendar; (d) change admission and registration requirements; (e) change the regulations and requirements governing instruction in, and graduation from, the university and its various divisions; and (f) change any other regulations affecting students. Changes shall go into force whenever the proper authorities so determine, and shall apply not only to prospective students but also to those who are degree-seeking at the time in the university. When economic and other conditions permit, the university tries to provide advance notice of such changes. In particular, when an instructional program is to be withdrawn, the university will make every reasonable effort to ensure that students who are within two years of completing the graduation requirements, and who are making normal progress toward the completion of those requirements, will have the opportunity to complete the program, which is to be withdrawn.
It is the policy of Boise State University to provide equal educational and employment opportunities, services, and benefits to students and employees without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, creed, age or handicap in accordance with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972. Sections 799A and 845 of the Public Health Act, and Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, where applicable, as enforced by the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.
NOTE: The courses contained in this catalog do not preclude or limit the university in its offerings for any semester or session nor do they restrict the university to the time block (semester) represented by the approved academic calendar.
Boise State University attempts to respond to the educational needs and wants of any and all students when expressed. Requests for courses to be offered whenever they are desired will be favorably received providing that a minimum of 12 qualified students enrolls in the class and a competent faculty member is available to teach the course.

Chapter 1—An Introduction to Boise State University

The City of Boise
Located along the Boise River in the shadows of the beautiful Rocky Mountain foothills, Boise State University is a vital component of Idaho’s capital city, a hub of business, the arts, health care, industry, technology and the power and politics of the Statehouse.
A 10-minute stroll from campus puts you downtown, where businesses cater to the college crowd, making it easy to take advantage of coffeehouses, restaurants, dance clubs and the city’s thriving cultural and entertainment scene. Even with big city amenities, Boise offers a safe, small-town feel and has repeatedly been named in the Top 10 for business, lifestyle and great outdoor recreation.
The City of Trees offers many unique attractions, including the Basque Museum and Cultural Center, Idaho Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial, the Idaho Shakespeare Festival, the World Center for Birds of Prey and a whitewater park on the Boise River.
The Boise Greenbelt, a more than 20-mile network of city parks and riverside paths, skirts the edge of campus. A footbridge spans the Boise River, linking Boise State to Julia Davis Park, home of the Boise Art Museum, Idaho State Museum, Idaho Black History Museum and Zoo Boise.
Beyond the city is a land of great variety. To the south are rich farmlands, a rugged, high-mountain desert, North America’s tallest sand dunes and the famous Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area. To the north, forests, whitewater rivers and mountain lakes provide opportunities for fishing, hiking, hunting and kayaking.

The University’s History
In 1932, the Episcopal Church founded Boise Junior College, the first postsecondary school in Idaho’s capital city. When the Episcopal Church discontinued its sponsorship in 1934, Boise Junior College became a nonprofit, private corporation sponsored by the Boise Chamber of Commerce and the community. In 1939, the State Legislature created a junior-college taxing district to fund the quickly growing institution.
By the end of the 1930s, Boise Junior College boasted an enrollment of 600 students. Originally located at St. Margaret’s Hall near the present site of St. Luke’s Regional Medical Center, the college was moved in 1940 to its present location alongside the Boise River. In 1965, Boise Junior College 

became a four-year institution and was renamed Boise College. In 1969, the college was brought into the state system of higher education as Boise State College. The Graduate College was established in 1971 and the creation of new graduate programs in 1974 led to the designation of the institution as Boise State University.
Boise State is the largest institution of higher education in Idaho with more than 28,000 students. During its history, Boise State University has operated under the leadership of seven presidents: Bishop Middleton Barnwell (1932-1934), Dr. Eugene B. Chaffee (1936-1967), Dr. John B. Barnes 
(1967-1977), Dr. John H. Keiser (1978-1991), Dr. Charles P. Ruch (1993-2003), Dr. Robert W. Kustra (2003-2018), and Dr. Marlene Tromp (2019-present).
Accreditation
Boise State University is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU).
Accreditation of an institution of higher education by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities indicates that it meets or exceeds criteria for the assessment of institutional quality evaluated through a peer review process. An accredited college or university is one that has available the necessary resources to achieve its stated purposes through appropriate educational programs, is substantially doing so, and gives reasonable evidence that it will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Institutional integrity is also addressed through accreditation.
Accreditation by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities is not partial, but applies to the institution as a whole. As such, it is not a guarantee of every course or program offered, or the competence of individual graduates. Rather, it provides reasonable assurance about the quality of opportunities available to students who attend the institution.
Inquiries regarding an institution’s accredited status by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities should be directed to the administrative staff of the Office of the Provost. Individuals may also contact: Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, 8060 165th Avenue N. E., Suite 200, Redmond, WA 98052, (425) 558-4224, nwccu.org/.
Many of Boise State University’s academic programs have special accreditation or endorsement from one or more of the following organizations:
• ABET, Inc.
• Accreditation Council for Genetic Counseling
• American Chemical Society
• American Council for Construction Education (ACCE)
• American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA)
• Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business-International
• Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs
• Committee on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE)
• Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care
• Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE)
• Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs
• Council for Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP)

• Society for Simulation in Healthcare (SSH)
State Authorization and Online Education Beyond Idaho
Boise State University delivers online education programs and courses throughout the United States and internationally and online offerings continue to expand. Idaho’s State Board of Education has approved all programs. Many states have prescribed an “authorization” process for out-of-state institutions delivering online programs to its state residents. Authorization (sometimes referred to as “registration,” “licensure,” “approval,” etc.) indicates that the institution has met certain minimum standards under the laws and regulations of that state. Authorization does not constitute an endorsement of any institution, course or degree program. Credits earned at an institution may not transfer to all other institutions.
Boise State has taken steps to protect its students and operations through nationwide compliance and currently participates in a voluntary State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA), at nc-sara.org/, encompassing all states except California. Boise State can operate without state authorization in California because it is a public accredited institution. More information about state authorization can be found at boisestate.edu/ecampus-center/stateauthorization/. More specific information about Boise State’s academic program availability can be found at: boisestate.edu/online/.
Professional Licensure Disclosures
States and other government entities have established standards of practice for the occupations or professions they have chosen to regulate, and they provide legal permission to practice those professions only to individuals who meet those standards. This is called professional licensure: professions for which people need to meet certain criteria in order to practice in that field.
If considering an academic program that leads to a professional license or certification in your state, it is highly recommended that you first seek guidance from the appropriate licensing agency in your home state before beginning the academic program located outside your state, or upon changing states.
Some online programs are not be available to residents in some states or not designed to prepare a student for professional licensure. Please contact the respective academic department before submitting an application. Information regarding professional licensure requirements in your state can be found at Boise State’s Professional Licensure Disclosures website, at: boisestate.edu/provost-licensure/.

Through an unshakeable focus on learning, we empower all to think critically and solve our world’s complex challenges. We excel through our values of inclusion, innovation, and integrity. Our vision is to be a leading studentsuccess driven college recognized for teaching and scholarship with statewide and global impact.
Approach to Learning and Instruction
Students are our top priority and our faculty are the most important contributors to students’ success in their educational programs at Boise State University. We value experimentation and change in the learning process, and we believe that continued and intensive intellectual interactions between faculty and students are essential to the students’ success. We encourage all students to develop and maintain a lifelong enthusiasm for learning, and to recognize that such lifelong learning is vital to their career success.
Faculty members are committed to providing the best education possible and are bringing innovative learning methods and technologies into the classroom. Many faculty members have active research groups, providing opportunities for undergraduate students to conduct research in their laboratories, participate in multidisciplinary projects and gain hands-on experience and depth to their academic career.
Courses are offered in a variety of formats including conventional lecture, laboratory, distance learning, and online delivery. Classrooms are designed to encourage both individual and team efforts.
Laboratories are equipped with state-of-the-art equipment. Networked computer lab facilities include both PC and UNIX environments with the latest versions of software.
Scholarships and Internships
Students are encouraged to apply for scholarships. More than $500,000 is awarded each year to students in the college. Applications for scholarships are available from the Financial Aid Office, Administration Building, Room 124, (208) 426-1664, online at boisestate.edu/scholarships/. Students are also strongly encouraged to participate in internship experiences during their college career. COEN graduates are surveyed each year, and 70% find employment in industry, 10% pursue graduate degrees, and 20% are still seeking employment after graduation. The biggest factor for not finding jobs is whether they obtained relevant experience prior to graduation. Additional hands-on experience can be gained through participating in research in one of our many faculty research laboratories. Students can also earn the Excellence in Undergraduate Research and Creative Activity (EURECA) designation. For details, see: boisestate.edu/undergraduate-research/ resources/resources-for-students/eureca/.
International Agreements
The College of Engineering participates in several exchange programs, which allow an undergraduate engineering student to attend a university in another country for a semester and apply credits from that institution toward their Boise State degree. In addition, the College of Engineering is a member of the Global Engineering Education Exchange (Global E3), an international program designed specifically for engineering students. A list of participating universities can be found at iie.org/en/Programs/Global-E3/Members. Students interested in participating in such an exchange program should contact their advisor at Boise State. Information about students who have recently studied abroad may be found here: boisestate.edu/coen/.

The College of Health Sciences dedicates itself to providing quality educational programs for students wishing to enter health professions. Programs in the college provide the general student body and Boise State University service area with educational offerings that increase awareness of healthy lifestyles and emphasize the value of prevention. The college is a leader in offering online programs and courses to students throughout Idaho, the region, the nation, and the world. Program goals are achieved through collaboration with area health partners including: medical centers, public health agencies, area nonprofit agencies, medical residencies and clinics, individual health community service, and faculty scholarly activities and hallmarks of programs in the college.
Accreditation
The college’s degree programs in athletic training, diagnostic medical sonography, diagnostic radiology, environmental and occupational health, genetic counseling, nursing, respiratory care, public health, and social work have all received accreditation from their national professional accrediting agencies. This recognition assures students that the program meets or exceeds the didactic and clinical competencies required by the specific accreditation agency.
Student Advising and Program Admission
Students are assisted with academic advising and other support efforts through the college’s Student Services and Academic Advising (SSAA) unit. The SSAA advisors assist all students not yet admitted into clinical programs (pre-nursing, pre-radiologic sciences, and pre-respiratory care), kinesiology, public health and health studies majors as well as pre-professional students who aim to apply to professional health-related programs in the future. SSAA provides specialized advising for students and is the initial contact point to assist students with academic planning and program admission criteria. The Boise State clinical programs have limitations on the numbers of new students they take into their programs each year, so prospective students should contact an advisor for specific prerequisite and application information and perform well in prerequisite courses to enhance their chance for acceptance.
Cooperating Agencies
Boise State University offers students a unique opportunity to continue their education off-campus and learn a health profession in state-of-the-art regional medical centers, state agencies, health and fitness facilities, and social/ community service organizations.

Chapter 2—General Policies

This chapter defines the general policies governing your rights as a student, academic integrity, student records, transcripts, enrollment status, name and address changes, student classification, declaring a major, and appeals.
Additional information on these policies is available from the Dean of Students (boisestate.edu/deanofstudents/) and the Boise State University Policy Manual (boisestate.edu/policy/).
Your Rights and Responsibilities
Boise State University challenges you to reach your highest level of performance, encourages you to excel in academics and sports, and invites you to participate in many cultural and social activities available at the university. At the same time, Boise State expects you to conduct yourself in a manner compatible with the university's function as an institution of higher learning. Therefore, we have published this catalog to acquaint you with your rights and responsibilities as a student.
Confidentiality and Privacy
Students’ Rights
For more information see University Policy 2250. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords you certain rights with respect to your education records. These rights include:
1. The right to inspect and review your education records within 45 days from the day the university receives a request for access.
You should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate official, a written request that identifies the record(s) you wish to inspect. The university official will make arrangements for access and notify you of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the university official to whom the request was submitted, the official shall advise you of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.
2. The right to request the amendment of your education records that you believe are inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of your privacy rights under FERPA.
If you wish to ask the university to amend a record, you should write to the university official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record you want changed, and specify why it should be changed. If Boise State decides not to amend the record as requested, the university will notify you in writing of the decision and your right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to you when you are notified of the right to a hearing.
3. The right to provide written consent before the university discloses personally identifiable information from your education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. The university can disclose education records without your prior written consent under the FERPA exception for disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for the university. A school official is a person employed by the university in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the university has contracted as its agent to provide a service instead of using university employees or officials (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another university official in performing his or her tasks.
4. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the university to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20202-8520.
The information listed below is considered directory information:
• your name
• your local address
• your permanent address
• your email address
• your local telephone number
• your major field of study
• the dates you attended Boise State
• your student classification (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, or graduate)
• your enrollment status (e.g., full-time or part-time)
• the type of degree you have earned from Boise State and the date it was awarded
• the dean’s list and other honors
Authorized Disclosure Without Consent
As of January 3, 2012, the U.S. Department of Education’s FERPA regulations expanded the circumstances when your education records and personally identifiable information (PII) contained in such records—including your Social Security number, grades, or other private information—may be accessed without your consent. First, the U.S. Comptroller General, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or state and local education authorities (“Federal and State Authorities”) may allow access to your records and PII without your consent to any third party designated by a Federal or State Authority to evaluate a federal- or state-supported education program. The evaluation may relate to any program that is “principally engaged in the provision of education,” such as early childhood education and job training, as well as any program that is administered by an education agency or institution. Second, Federal and State Authorities may allow access to your education records and PII without your consent to researchers performing certain types of studies, in certain cases even when we object to or do not request such research. Federal and State Authorities must obtain certain use-restriction and data security promises from the entities that they authorize to receive your PII, but the authorities need not maintain direct control over such entities. In addition, in connection with Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems, State Authorities may collect, compile, permanently retain, and share without your consent PII from your education records, and they may track your participation in education and other programs by linking such PII to other personal information about you that they obtain from other Federal or State data sources, including workforce development, unemployment insurance, child welfare, juvenile justice, military service, and migrant student records systems. If you wish to limit access to this information, go to myBoiseState Help at boisestate.edu/oit-myboisestate/ and scroll to Student Center—Personal Information and click on Update FERPA Restrictions link for instructions. In discharging their official duties, Boise State employees may read, review, photocopy, and distribute to appropriate persons within the university any information contained in your student record. However, before distributing confidential information outside the university—even to members of your family— Boise State faculty and staff must first secure your written permission to do so.
You must complete a Release of Information form to allow individuals other than yourself to access your educational or financial records. The form can be located at boisestate.edu/registrar/student-forms/.

Academic Integrity
The university’s goal is to foster an intellectual atmosphere that produces educated people who are skilled in the discipline of their choice. Because cheating, plagiarism, and academic misconduct as a whole are at odds with this goal, these actions shall not be tolerated in any form. You are expected to adhere to the rules and regulations as set forth in the Student Code of Conduct (Policy 2020). Therefore, all work you submit must represent your own ideas and effort; when the work does not, you have engaged in academic dishonesty while preventing your own learning and skill-development.
Plagiarism is presenting work, ideas, or direct quotes from another source as your own, without specific and proper acknowledgment, documentation, and/ or citation. For example, academic dishonesty occurs whenever you:
• buy a paper or other project, then seek to receive credit for your learning for that paper or project
• copy from another student’s exam, either before, during, or after the exam
• use unauthorized aides of any kind while taking an exam or use information stored in a computer or calculator (if prohibited from doing so)
• allow another person to take an exam in your place or take an exam for another person
• collaborate on take-home exams when such collaboration is forbidden, or overextend collaboration expectations
• copy the work of another person and attempt to receive credit for that work
• fail to properly document source material in a paper or project as the work of another
• receive editorial assistance that falls outside the scope of assisting with your development of a learner and crosses into unauthorized collaboration Note: The list above is intended only to provide some examples for recognizing and avoiding common types of academic dishonesty. It is in no way an exhaustive or comprehensive list of all the types of academic dishonesty. For more nuance on the topic, please consult the Student Code of Conduct (Policy 2020).
Instructors of record are responsible for assessing and deciding responsibility/ non-responsibility in instances of potential academic misconduct, and are bestsupported in offering due process to students when referring incidents to the Academic Integrity Program inside the Office of the Dean of Students. If you are responsible for academic dishonesty, you may be subject to course grade sanctions up to a failing grade for the course, educational/developmental sanctions, and/or sanctions outlined in the Student Code of Conduct (Policy 2020) as suspension or expulsion.
For more detailed information and process guidance about academic honesty and misconduct, see the following university policies:
• Student Code of Conduct (Policy 2020)
• Boise State Policy 4180, Faculty Responsibility to Address Student Academic Misconduct
General Notice of Nondiscrimination
It is the policy of Boise State University to comply with all federal, state and local authorities requiring nondiscrimination, including but not limited to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 504 of the

Providing Equal Access to People with Disabilities
Boise State is committed to creating a diverse and inclusive campus environment by abiding by the letter and spirit of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Accordingly, the university does not discriminate against persons with disabilities and strives to provide an exceptional academic experience for students with disabilities by providing reasonable and appropriate accommodations for equitable access.
Boise State’s Educational Access Center (EAC) coordinates services to meet the educational needs of students with documented disabilities. The EAC works with students and faculty to arrange reasonable accommodations and promote an environment that is free of both physical and attitudinal barriers. Students with disabilities needing accommodations to participate fully in academic programming should contact the EAC. All accommodations must be approved through the EAC prior to being implemented. To learn more about the accommodation process, visit the EAC’s website at boisestate.edu/eac/.

Student Records
Boise State University routinely collects, stores, and maintains many kinds of information about prospective, current, and former students. For instance, Admissions maintains a file for each student who has applied for admission to the university for a period of two to five years (see Chapter 3—Admissions for details). Other files at the Registrar’s Office contain your permanent transcript. Faculty and departments also may maintain files containing advising records, grades sheets, and correspondence.
In general, you have the right to review the documents that constitute your official record. If you wish to do so, please contact the Registrar’s Office, Administration Building, Room 110, (208) 426-4249.
GENERAL POLICIES
Transcript Records
If you have myBoiseState (my.boisestate.edu/) access, your account connects to the National Student Clearinghouse to place an order and pay. If you do not have myBoiseState access, you can go to the National Student Clearinghouse (tsorder.studentclearinghouse.org/school/select) to place an order and pay. You can access unofficial transcripts in your Student Center on myBoiseState. The Registrar’s Office makes every effort to ensure your transcript records are up-todate and accurate. If you believe there is an error or an omission on your transcript, contact the Registrar’s Office, Administration Building, Room 110, (208) 426-4249.
Address Changes
Whenever Boise State University policies or procedures call for a university office to send you a written notification, that obligation is fulfilled when that office mails the notification to your last mailing address on record. If you are currently enrolled or have access to a myBoiseState account, you must update address information on myBoiseState (my.boisestate.edu/) on your Student Center (under the update personal information tile, select Addresses). If you are a former student, and do not have access to a myBoiseState account, submit an Information Update form (located at boisestate.edu/registrar/studentforms/) form to the Registrar’s Office, Administration Building, Room 110.
Verification of Your Enrollment Status
Your enrollment status is public information, unless you have notified the university that you want it to be treated as confidential (see Confidentiality and Privacy in this chapter). In responding to inquiries from outside the university, Boise State calculates your enrollment status per Table 2.1. Requests for verification of enrollment status often come from such businesses as employment agencies, insurance companies, and lending agencies.
Table 2.1
Schedule Used to Determine Undergraduate 
Enrollment Status
(in Response to Outside Inquiries)Number of Credits (Currently enrolled)Enrollment Status12 or moreFull-Time9 to 11Three-Quarter-Time6 to 8Half-Time5 or fewerLess Than Half-TimeNote: If you are receiving benefits under the G. I. Bill, you should contact the 
Veteran Services Office, located in the Lincoln Garage, on the corner of Lincoln Ave. and University Dr., (208) 426-3744, to determine your enrollment status.
Exceptions for student body officers and student editors are outlined in Idaho State Board of Education Policy III. P.7. a. i-ii. 20!Boise State University 2024-2025 Undergraduate Catalog
Student Classification
The university classifies each student per the definitions provided in Table 2.2.
       Table 2.2 Student ClassificationsClassificationDefinitionFreshmanHas earned 0 to 25 credits. SophomoreHas earned 26 to 57 credits. Sophomore is the maximum classification for students in associates or certificate programs. JuniorHas earned 58 to 89 credits. SeniorHas earned 90 or more credits or is pursuing a second baccalaureate degree. GraduateHas earned a baccalaureate degree, has been admitted to the Graduate College, and is pursuing a graduate degree. Name Changes
You should promptly report a name change. You may do so by going to boisestate.edu/registrar/student-forms/, completing a Student Name Update form and returning the form to the Registrar’s Office, Administration Building, Room 110. You must provide evidence showing that your name has officially changed, such as a valid driver's license or Social Security card.
Note: If you are currently or were previously employed (even as a student), you must report your name change to the Department of Human Resource Services, 2525 W. University Drive, Capitol Village #3, (208) 426-1616 (documentation requirements may differ).
Preferred Name
You may choose to use a preferred name while in attendance. Update your preferred name by accessing your Student Center, on myBoiseState (my.boisestate.edu/) on the Update Personal Info tile. Multiple systems within the university utilize preferred names (e.g., myBoiseState, Canvas, Student Housing, class rosters). Your username and email account may also be generated to match your preferred name. All official documents, academic records (i.e., transcripts) and university reports use only your primary or legal name.
Declaring a Major
If you are a student seeking a baccalaureate degree, you must declare a major field of study by the time you are classified as a junior. You will be classified a junior when 58 credits have been earned (see Table 2.2).
For your convenience, if you are a student who has not yet selected a major field of study (undeclared), you can declare a major by logging on to your myBoiseState Student Center (my.boisestate.edu/) and select Change My Major in the My Academics tab. For more information, contact the Registrar’s Office, Administration Building, Room 110, (208) 426-4249. Additional information about majors can be found in Chapter 10—Obtaining a Degree at Boise State University.
Right of Appeal
You have the right to appeal any academic policy or requirement if either of the following conditions is present:
• Extenuating circumstances make it impossible for you to comply with the policy or requirement.
• An undue hardship would result from a strict application or interpretation of the policy or requirement.
Please note, however, that extenuating circumstances must be beyond your control and that undue hardship must be a condition far more serious than simple inconvenience. Documentation will be required and the timeliness of the appeal will be taken into consideration.
It is extremely rare for appeals requesting past semester changes to be approved beyond 5 years after a semester has ended, even when there is documented proof of an unusual or extraordinary circumstance beyond your control. The committee does approve past semester changes beyond 5 years, if you can document an administrative error on the part of the university.
The committee does not approve past semester changes for any courses taken before a posted degree, no matter when or where the degree was earned and regardless of whether the courses were used in the earning of that degree, unless there is documentation of an administrative error on the part of the university. If you appeal an academic policy or requirement, the dean of the college responsible for your major or the University Academic Appeals Committee will most likely review that appeal. For more information about appeals and grievances, see the Boise State University Policy Manual, boisestate.edu/policy/ and the Dean of Students website boisestate.edu/deanofstudents/.
GENERAL POLICIES
Last Week of Classes and Final Exams
No undergraduate classes provided by Boise State University will give any test or examination during the last seven calendar days preceding the first day of the officially scheduled final examination period of the fall or spring semester (traditionally referred to as “Dead Week”), except in those particular courses that are offered in an accelerated time frame less than 15 weeks and/or wherein it is deemed necessary by departmental policy (e.g., lab, artistic performance, project presentation, team analysis, etc.). See University Policy 3080. Online courses are expected to adhere to the policy whenever possible, but they are allowed to make exceptions when the course schedule differs from the regular semester schedule.
• In-class final or take-home final exams will be given and/or due during the officially scheduled final examination periods.
• No take home test or exam may be made due during the last week of classes.
• Test or exam dates during the last week of classes are not subject to personal preferences (e.g., faculty preference, class vote, or other means of general consensus).
• Exceptions may be allowed for extenuating circumstances, on an individual student basis, to be arranged at a time agreeable to the faculty member.
Each semester, a schedule for final examinations is published on the Registrar’s Office website at boisestate.edu/registrar/boise-state-academic-calendars/finalexam-schedules/. This schedule defines the dates and times when all final examinations must be scheduled.

Chapter 3—Admissions

Admissions works with prospective and newly admitted undergraduate students. The primary functions are to:
• serve students, families, community and stake stakeholders, and internal partners as it relates to the enrollment process 
• host campus tours and other on- and off-campus recruitment events
• provide customer service for prospective and newly admitted students and their families
• process applications for admission in accordance with state and institutional policies
• provide systems and data integrity support 
The following sections define the dates for admission applications, the process that Admissions determines your admission status, and the standards you must meet to be admitted to Boise State. Included are instructions to apply for admission. You can also find this information at boisestate.edu/admissions Note: If you are planning to pursue graduate studies and are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, you must apply for admission through Graduate Admissions. For more information, see the Boise State University Graduate Catalog or contact Graduate Admission and Degree Services, Riverfront Hall, Room 307, (208) 426-3903, boisestate.edu/graduatecollege.
Verification and Submission of Academic Transcripts
The accuracy of your academic history is verified by requiring official transcripts be sent directly from your school to Boise State University. These transcripts can be sent to Boise State via a sealed envelope or through an approved third-party credentials solution vendor. While Boise State may, at times, make exceptions for the admission process regarding “official transcripts,” we always require an official transcript at the point of enrollment. In cases where a student's transcript or school is in question, we reach out to the school directly via phone or email.
Validity of High School Completion
If either Boise State University or the U.S. Department of Education suspect that a student’s high school diploma is not valid or was not obtained from an entity that provides secondary school education, Boise State University will take the following steps to evaluate the validity of the student’s high school completion. To satisfy this requirement, we may:
• Check with the high school to confirm the validity of the student’s diploma; and
• Confirm with the relevant department or agency in the state in which the secondary school is located that the secondary school is recognized as a provider of secondary school education.
• Other approaches may also be used if they serve to validate the student’s  high school completion.
How to Apply for Admission
To apply for undergraduate admission, submit all materials required based on applicant status (see Important Deadlines, page 23).

Standards for Transfer Students
If you have completed 14 or more transferable semester (21 quarter) credits after graduating from high school, have a cumulative 2.25 GPA or higher, and were in good academic standing at the current/last institution you attended, you will be admitted with regular admission.
If you have completed 14 or more transferable semester credits (21 quarter credits) after graduating from high school, and have earned an Associate of Arts or Associate of Science or are core certified from an accredited academic institution, and have a 2.00 GPA or higher, you will be admitted with regular admission.
If you have completed more than 14 credits after high school, but have not yet earned an associate degree or core certification, and have a GPA range of 2.00 to 2.24, your application will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine your potential for academic success.
If you have completed fewer than 14 academic semester credits after high school, you will be considered for admission based on your high school transcript (or high school equivalency credential) and your college record.
If you have less than a 2.00 cumulative transfer GPA, you will not be eligible for degree-seeking admission. You may choose to improve your GPA at your current institution or attend Boise State as a nondegree-seeking student.
If you were dismissed from a college or university within the last semester, you are not eligible to attend Boise State until sitting out at least a fall or spring semester.
Standards for Returning Students
If you have completed fewer than 14 academic semester credits, you will be considered for admission based on your high school transcript (or high school equivalency credential) and your college record. If you are returning to Boise State with 14 or more completed college-level credits, you will be considered for admission based on college coursework you have completed since leaving Boise State. If you have not attended another college since leaving Boise State, and you have not previously been dismissed from Boise State, you are only required to submit a new application for admission. If you have attended any other colleges or universities since attending Boise State, you will need to have a cumulative 2.25 GPA or higher on all post-Boise State coursework. If you were previously academically dismissed from Boise State, you must sit out for one semester (fall or spring) after the first dismissal and for one academic year after any subsequent dismissal before you can apply for reinstatement. You will be permitted no more than two (2) reinstatements. A third dismissal is final, unless a successful appeal is made to the Registrar's Office.
Standards for Second Baccalaureate Degree Students
If you have a baccalaureate degree from an accredited academic institution and will take undergraduate courses, either as a nondegree or degree-seeking student, you must apply for undergraduate admission. If applying for degreeseeking status, a 2.00 cumulative GPA is required for regular admission. Once admitted, you must meet with the department chair of your major to determine your degree requirements.
If you already have a baccalaureate degree and will take graduate courses and ultimately your intent is to pursue graduate studies, either as a nondegree or degree-seeking student, you apply through the Graduate College. For more information, see the Boise State University Graduate Catalog.
Standards for Nondegree-seeking Students
If you are applying for admission solely to take courses of interest, applying for nondegree-seeking status is a convenient option. Nondegree-seeking status simply requires that you have a high school diploma* from an accredited high school or a GED. Applicants must not have been dismissed from a college or university within the last semester. As a nondegree-seeking student during fall and spring semesters, you can register for any combination of courses totaling 7 or fewer credits, or 2 courses totaling 8 credits. The summer session has no credit limit. Any credits that you earn as a nondegree-seeking student are applicable toward earning a degree. Please be aware that nondegree-seeking students pay part-time fees; those deemed nonresidents of Idaho pay additional per-credit nonresident tuition. Also, nondegree-seeking students are not eligible to receive federal financial aid. Students who were dismissed at any other college or university are not eligible to attend Boise State until sitting out at least a fall or spring semester.

*With a TOEFL iBT score of at least 38, IELTS score of 4.5, or Duolingo English Test score of 65. To participate in the Pathway Program, you must first enroll in the Intensive English Program. Please refer to the Intensive English Program website at boisestate.edu/globaleducation-iep/ for information.
Pathway Program
The Boise State Pathway Program is designed for students who seek admission to a Boise State degree but whose English proficiency level does not meet the Boise State requirement for full admission. The Pathway Program offers language skill development, academic preparation and ongoing cultural and academic orientation to secure students’ success at Boise State and beyond. While in the Pathway Program, students advance their English language skills while simultaneously making academic progress toward graduation requirements. The Pathway Program is equipped to provide the best introduction to the U.S. classroom style, academic culture and study skills. Upon successful completion of the Pathway Program, students are granted full admission to Boise State University and can move on to their respective academic departments and take full-time academic courses.
Health Insurance Coverage
All students on F-1 and J-1 student visas must purchase the university’s health insurance plan. For information about required health insurance, contact the Health Insurance and Billing Office at healthinsurance@boisestate.edu or (208) 426-2158.
Your Admission Status
After reviewing your application and supporting materials, Admissions will make an admission decision. Specifically, you will either be admitted with regular, conditional or nondegree-seeking status, or be denied admission to the university. Each type of admission status is defined below, along with any special restrictions associated with that type of status.
Regular Status – You meet all requirements for admission to the university. No special restrictions apply to your admission and no further transcripts or information is required.
Conditional Status – You have been admitted on conditional status because the transcript you submitted was in-progress. Once Admissions reviews your official transcript with final grades, you will be assigned a final admission status. Your admission under conditional status may remain in effect for no longer than one semester. You will not be able to register for subsequent semesters until you submit an official transcript with grades reported for all coursework completed.
Denied Status – You do not meet the standards for admission and are denied as a degree-seeking student. You may inquire with Admissions about options moving forward and how to strengthen your application to apply for a future semester.
Nondegree-seeking Status – Designed for students applying solely to take courses of interest. As a nondegree-seeking student, you can register for any combination of courses totaling 7 or fewer credits, or 2 courses totaling 8 credits. The summer session has no credit limit. These credits are applicable toward a degree if you are later admitted as a degree-seeking student. However, if you are nondegree-seeking, you are ineligible for federal financial aid.

Chapter 4—Registration Policies and Procedures

This chapter discusses policies related to orientation, registration, dropping or adding courses, and withdrawals. Registration takes place each semester, including summer session, and consists of three distinct phases: continuing, new, and open registration. As an active student, you will be assigned an enrollment appointment. Beginning at that time and until registration closes, you can log onto your Student Center via myBoiseState (my.boisestate.edu/) and register. General descriptions of continuing, new, and open registration are provided below.
In addition, this chapter defines the policies and procedures governing complete withdrawals from Boise State University, faculty-initiated withdrawals, and administrative withdrawals from the university. Finally, this chapter defines policies governing credit and audit status.
Academic Calendar
Boise State’s Academic Calendar, which lists all the registration deadline dates for the current catalog year, can be found in the front of this catalog and on the Registrar’s website at boisestate.edu/registrar/boise-state-academic-calendars. The Academic Calendar specifies the policy deadlines by semester and session for the following: registration, adding and dropping classes, changing from audit-tocredit or credit-to-audit, and withdrawals. You are strongly encouraged to familiarize yourself with this calendar, especially the Deadlines by Session table located at the top of the Academic Calendar, as you will be held accountable for meeting these deadlines.
Academic and Fee Policy
Once you register for classes, you remain registered and are held responsible for the fees and grades assessed for these classes unless you cancel your registration. If you do not pay for or do not attend these classes, you are still held responsible for the fees and grades assessed. If you decide not to attend any classes, you must log in to your Student Center on myBoiseState (my.boisestate.edu) no later than the deadline and drop all classes (see the 
Academic Calendar Deadlines by Session table and Rules for Dropping a Workshop). This includes any courses and workshops that begin later in the semester and any courses still waitlisted.
If you do not cancel your registration or pay your fees by the fee payment deadline, you will remain registered, you will be charged course fees, and you will be assessed a $50 late penalty.
Please note: cancellation of courses may have financial aid impacts. You may be required to repay all, or a portion, of any financial aid awarded to you.
Enrollment Appointments
Continuing Students
If you are an active degree-seeking student, you may register during continuing registration, which is held in March/April (for the upcoming fall semester) and in October/November (for the upcoming spring semester). Summer session registration occurs in February for the upcoming summer. For the exact date for when continuing registration begins, consult the Academic Calendar. During continuing registration you may register by appointment on myBoiseState (my.boisestate.edu/), according to a schedule established by the Registrar’s Office. Appointments are assigned based on credits completed (not including current semester in-progress credits). Once appointments have been assigned, the Registrar’s Office will notify you via BroncoMail to check your appointment time on myBoiseState (my.boisestate.edu/).
New and Transfer Students
If you are a new degree-seeking student (including transfer), you are expected to sign up for, and attend, an Orientation program where you will be advised and register for classes. Orientation programs are held for both the fall and spring semesters; upon admission or readmission, you will receive an email with directions to RSVP for a program. Space is limited in each program and you should RSVP at your earliest convenience.
Orientation will connect you to Boise State services and community, provide you with academic advising, and assist you with registration. Contact the New Student Transition and Family Connections Office at (208) 426-1679 or visit boisestate.edu/orientation/ for more information.
Readmitted and Returning Students
If you are a readmitted or returning student, you will be assigned an appointment during continuing registration, which is held in April (for the upcoming fall semester) and in November (for the upcoming spring semester). Your appointment time will appear on your myBoiseState (my.boisestate.edu/) account.
If you do not see an appointment time on your account by the beginning of 
April for fall and by the beginning of November for spring, please contact the 
Registrar’s Office at (208) 426-4249 or stop by the Administration Building, Room 110.
Nondegree-seeking Students
If you are a nondegree-seeking student, your registration occurs during Open Registration.
Open Registration
Open registration for the fall semester begins the Tuesday prior to the start of the term.
Open registration for the spring begins the Monday after winter commencement.
Open registration for the summer sessions begins in February. See the Academic Calendar Deadlines by Session table for specific dates.
Credit/Audit Status
During registration on myBoiseState (my.boisestate.edu) you may elect to take a course for audit instead of credit if space is available in the class. Register by selecting audit status with the understanding that you will receive neither credit nor a grade (A+ through F) and regular course fees apply. On your transcript, audit status indicates that you had a seat in the class, but may or may not have participated in class activities. You may change your registration status from credit-to-audit or audit-to-credit until the appropriate session deadline (see the Academic Calendar Deadlines by Session table). If you fail to meet the audit requirements established by the instructor, the instructor may give you a final grade of UAU (Unsatisfactory Audit). For more information, contact the Registrar’s Office, Administration Building, Room 110, (208) 426-4249.
Adding Classes
You may add classes to your schedule through the Student Center on myBoiseState (my.boisestate.edu/), based on your enrollment appointment and if there is space available in the class. If a class is full, you may place yourself on a waitlist to enroll in the class if a seat becomes available. You may continue to add classes after the first day of classroom instruction up to the appropriate session deadline. However, after the fifth day of the semester’s regular session, you must obtain the instructor’s approval to add the class. Instructors may refuse to grant a permission number if the class is full (see the Academic Calendar Deadlines by Session table in the front of this catalog for the exact deadline). They may also refuse permission if your late entry would prevent you from benefiting fully from the class, or would prevent other students in the class from doing so. If you do receive a permission number, enter the number in your Student Center when you register for the class. If you are registering for, or adding, a directed research, an independent study, internship/practicum, or reading and conference, you may do so through the end of the sixth week of the semester (see the Academic Calendar Deadlines by Session table).
REGISTRATION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
Waitlisting
When attempting to enroll in a full course, you may be given the option to put yourself on the waitlist for the course. Your eligibility to be on the waitlist depends on whether you meet the requisites for the course. Please note that some courses do not provide a waitlist option. Once on a waitlist, if a seat becomes available, you will automatically be added to the course and notified via an email sent to your BroncoMail account. If you are on multiple waitlists for different sections of the same course, you will be removed from the other waitlists at that time. The waitlist process runs five times daily throughout the registration period prior to the last day a class can be added without an instructor’s permission (see the Academic Calendar Deadlines by Session table). If you are already enrolled in another section of the course that is waitlisted, or have time conflicts with other courses, you will not be enrolled via the waitlist process.
21-Credit Cap
You may enroll in a maximum of 21 credits per term. If you want to take more than 21 credits in a term, you will need to work with your advisor to complete the Request to Exceed 21 Credit Hours form.
For more information about adding classes, contact the Registrar’s Office, Administration Building, Room 110, (208) 426-4249.
Dropping Classes
You may drop regular session classes from your schedule, by accessing your 
Student Center on myBoiseState (my.boisestate.edu/). See the Academic Calendar Deadlines by Session table in the front of this catalog for the exact session deadlines. If you drop a regular session class before the tenth day of the semester, the class will not appear on your transcript. However, if you drop a regular session class after the tenth day of the semester, your transcript will show a grade of W (for withdrawal) for that class. Grades of W will not be used in GPA calculation (see Withdrawals for the maximum number of W grades you can accrue). Workshops, short courses, five-week, and seven-week block courses have different deadline dates. See the Academic Calendar Deadlines by Session table in this catalog for the exact deadline.
Withdrawals
• You may accrue up to ten (10) withdrawals for a baccalaureate degree and up to five (5) for an associate degree.
• Any grades of W received in an associate degree program count toward the 10 allowed for the baccalaureate degree program.
• Withdrawals from co-requisite courses (lecture/lab) will count as one W, unless the co-requisite courses are two separate graded courses.
• Grades of W earned prior to Spring 2014 semester are not counted toward the number allowed.
Once you have exhausted the number of W grades allowed, you may be removed from your major. Once you have completed a degree, you may earn an additional ten (10) grades of W toward a second baccalaureate degree or an additional five (5) grades of W toward an additional associate degree.
Note: The university has placed limits on the number of times you may enroll in a course. For more information, see Chapter 5—Grades, Repeating a Course. Note: If you intend to drop a class where you have been issued university property—such as uniforms, instruments, or lab equipment—you must return the property before dropping the class. If you fail to do so, the department will place a hold on your record.
Drop Fee
You are expected to finalize your class schedule at the beginning of each term. Dropping unwanted courses as the semester begins allows other students the opportunity to add the courses they need. You will have the opportunity to attend the first class session to make a decision to stay enrolled or drop before a $10 drop fee per course is charged. The drop fee deadlines vary by session. See Academic Calendar Deadlines by Session table for the deadlines. For more information about dropping classes, contact the Student Financial Services, Administration Building, Room 101, (208) 426-1212.
Workshops
Workshops have special deadlines. Special Session 1 (SP1) is typically utilized for workshop or special event courses that span four days or fewer. This will allow you to add up until the day before the class begins and drop with a W one day before the class ends. If the class is dropped the last day, the drop will result in a grade of F.
Special Session 2 (SP2) is used to schedule courses that fall outside of standard predefined sessions (e.g., 1st 7-week, 2nd 5-week), and that span 5 days or more. This will allow you to add through the first day of class and drop without a W through the second day of class. The last date to drop with a W varies by course, and you are strongly encouraged to access your class schedule on myBoiseState (my.boisestate.edu/) and click on the Deadline link for the specific class to confirm the final penalty date. Courses dropped after the final penalty date will result in a grade of F.
To enroll in a workshop that is full and has not started yet, you must submit a 
Registration Override Form, with the instructor’s signature, to the Registrar’s Office, Administration Building, Room 110, (208) 426-4249, no later than the day before the workshop starts. Workshops do not have permission numbers.
Appeals to Withdraw from a Class After the Deadline
If you need to drop a class in a current semester after the last drop deadline for the session, but before the session ends, you must submit an appeal using the Request to Withdraw from a Class After the Deadline form. Read the instructions, fill out the form, submit a written letter, and provide documentation of extenuating circumstances that would justify an exemption to the drop deadline policy. The instructor may deny the appeal. If the instructor signs the form, then you can proceed to request approval and signature from the dean (or associate dean) of the college offering the course. If the dean or associate dean approves to drop the class with a W, the college will submit the form to the Registrar’s Office, Administration Building, Room 110, (208) 426-4249, for processing. The form is located online at boisestate.edu/registrar/studentforms.
Faculty-Initiated Withdrawals
An instructor has the option of withdrawing you from a course if any of the following conditions are present:
• you fail to attend one of the first two meetings of a class that meets more than once each week, or
• you fail to attend the first meeting of a class that meets once each week, or
• you do not satisfy the initial participation requirements of a fully online class.
You should not expect that an instructor will withdraw you for nonattendance. The primary responsibility for course withdrawal rests with you. To withdraw a student for failing to attend one of the first two meetings of a class that meets more than once each week or the first meeting of a class that meets once each week, the instructor has the option to submit a FacultyInitiated Withdrawal Form online to the Registrar’s Office, Administration Building, Room 110, (208) 426-4249, by the last day to add a class without permission for the session. If you are withdrawn from a course for failing to attend these specified class meetings, you may re-enroll in the course with the instructor’s permission through the tenth day of the semester (see the Academic Calendar Deadlines by Session table in this catalog for the exact deadline of the various sessions).
Department-Initiated Withdrawals
To be withdrawn for failing to satisfy entrance requirements, the department must notify you of the impending withdrawal and then request the withdrawal through the Registrar’s Office. All department-initiated withdrawals will be removed from your record and will not appear on your transcript. See University Policy 4185 for department-initiated withdrawal reasons.
Attendance Policy
You are responsible for attending courses in which you are enrolled. You are also responsible for making up any work you may have missed by failing to attend class, even if the absence was approved by Boise State University, necessitated by illness, or necessitated by a personal emergency. In this sense, then, there are no “excused” absences.
Please note, you should consult your course syllabus for the instructor’s class attendance policy.
Complete Withdrawal from Boise State
If you wish to leave the university in good standing, you must drop all your current semester classes and remove yourself from any waitlists by logging in to your Student Center on myBoiseState (my.boisestate.edu). Withdrawals on or after the first day of instruction are subject to a $40 administrative processing fee. If the complete withdrawal for regular session is made after the 10th day of classes and you have not paid your fees, you are still responsible for the entire amount of fees incurred plus a nonrefundable $40.00 administrative processing fee. If you do not cancel your registration or completely withdraw by the appropriate deadline for the session, you will be awarded a final grade of F. See University Policy 4185. See the Academic Calendar Deadlines by Session table in the front of this catalog for specific deadlines for the various sessions.
A complete withdrawal (CW on the transcript) after the published deadline will only be granted by appeal and because of extraordinary circumstances. An Academic Appeal Form must be completed and submitted to the Registrar’s Office. The Academic Appeal form can be found online at boisestate.edu/ registrar/home/student-forms/ For information on refunds of tuition and fees following a complete withdrawal, see Chapter 6—Tuition and Fees.
Financial Aid and Withdrawals
If you withdraw from the university, you need to be aware of federal regulations impacting your financial aid eligibility. Withdrawals will impact your compliance with Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). Please see the policy at boisestate.edu/financialaid/. 
REGISTRATION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
Complete withdrawals may also result in a financial obligation by you to return the unearned portion of any federal aid that disbursed to you, or your student account. You must repay Boise State for any unearned aid that had applied toward tuition and fee charges. A repayment may also be required for unearned aid disbursed directly to you. A full explanation of this policy, including examples, is available at boisestate.edu/financialaid/home/impacts-on-aid/. 
If you are considering withdrawing from Boise State, we strongly recommend that you review this information. If you still have questions, please contact the Financial Aid Office, (208) 426-1664, for more information.
Administrative Withdrawal from Boise State
An administrative withdrawal is the process by which Boise State formally withdraws you from one class, multiple classes, and/or from the university, usually without your consent or cooperation. You may be administratively withdrawn for a variety of reasons, including the following:
• failing to pay library fines, overdue loans, deferred fee payments, housing accounts, or other such charges,
• falsifying information on an admissions application or other university record or document,
• failing to respond to an official summons issued by the university,
• failing to pass prerequisite coursework,
• failing to meet academic standards, or
• exhibiting behavior that constitutes a clear and present danger to yourself or to others.
Administrative withdrawals due to nonpayment of financial obligations are recorded with a grade of W and appear on your transcript if processed after the tenth day of the semester.
Administrative withdrawals due to ineligibility to be in a course or continue in school for reasons other than nonpayment of financial obligations may or may not appear on your transcript.
Notification of administrative withdrawals are sent to your BroncoMail account.

Chapter 5—GradesBoise State University’s Grading System
Boise State University uses a 4.00 grading scale. Table 5.1 lists the letter grades that instructors use to document their evaluation of your work and your academic status in the class. In addition, Table 5.1 defines the meaning of each letter grade and specifies the number of quality points that correspond to each grade. Quality points are used to determine your grade-point average (GPA). The procedure for calculating your GPA is described under How to Calculate Your Grade-Point Average (GPA) below.
Table 5.1—Letter GradesLetter GradeMeaningQuality Points per Credit HourUsed to 
Calculate GPA? A+Distinguished work4YesADistinguished work4YesA-Distinguished work3.7YesB+Superior work3.3YesBSuperior work3YesB-Superior work2.7YesC+Average work2.3YesCAverage work2YesC-Average work1.7YesD+Below-average work1.3YesDBelow-average work1YesD-Below-average work.7YesFFailure0YesPPass: satisfactory work equivalent to C or higher; credits earned0NoIIncomplete (See Incomplete Grades in this chapter. )0

Grade-Point Average (GPA)
Boise State calculates and documents three types of grade-point averages (GPA):
• Cumulative GPA
• Semester or term GPA
• Boise State GPA
Each of the three types of GPA is calculated with the same formula:
Total quality points earned divided by GPA credits attempted = GPA
In calculating your cumulative GPA, Boise State uses courses you have taken at the university in your current career and all courses you have transferred from other post-secondary institutions—but only if you received a final letter grade (A+ through F) in those transferred courses. During any semester you can be enrolled in one of two possible careers: undergraduate or graduate.
In calculating semester GPA, the formula uses only the quality points earned and GPA credits attempted that semester. For Boise State GPA, the formula uses only quality points earned and GPA credits attempted at Boise State in your current career.
All GPA calculations exclude credits for:
• pass/fail courses in which you received a final grade of P 
(Note: a grade of F will impact your GPA),
• courses that you registered for, but later dropped from your schedule, even though the course may appear on your transcript with a final grade of W or CW,
• courses you took under audit status (AUD or UAU), and
• courses in which you have received the grade of I, for incomplete (until the I is changed to a letter grade).
Incomplete Grades
Instructors can enter a grade of I—for incomplete—if both of the following conditions are present:
• You have completed either 80% of the course or 80% of the coursework.
• Extenuating circumstances make it impossible for you to complete the course before the end of the semester.
To receive an incomplete, you and your instructor must agree to a contract stipulating the work you must do and the time in which it must be completed for you to receive a grade in the class. The terms of this contract are viewable on myBoiseState (my.boisestate.edu/) under your Student Center To Do List. The contract time varies as set by the instructor, but may not exceed one year. If no grade other than incomplete has been assigned one year after the original incomplete, a grade of F will automatically be assigned. The grade of F may not be changed without approval of the University Academic Appeals Committee. As long as you have an incomplete in a class, you may not re-enroll in the class during another semester. A grade of incomplete is excluded from GPA calculations until you receive a final grade in the course. You cannot graduate with a grade of I (incomplete) on your record.
Dean’s List
The dean’s list is a roster of undergraduate students who have received very high grades during a particular fall or spring semester of full-time enrollment. To be included in the dean’s list, you must meet the following criteria:
• You must complete 12 or more college-level credit hours in a given semester, excluding classes graded Pass/Fail.
• For that semester, you must attain a semester grade-point average (GPA) of 3.50 or higher.
• For that semester, you may not receive a grade of I for incomplete.
You will receive an Honors designation on the dean’s list if you attain a GPA of 3.50 to 3.74, High Honors for a GPA of 3.75 to 3.99, and Highest Honors for a GPA of 4.00. This designation will appear on your transcript.
Repeating a Course
If you wish to improve your grade in a course, you may register for an individual course a maximum of two (2) times. Third or subsequent attempts require approval of the academic advisor of your major and the chair of the department offering the course on a Request to Exceed Maximum Course Registration form. 
Grades of W and CW count in the individual course maximum of two (2) times. Prior learning credits cannot be used to repeat a course.
Effective Spring 2014, while earning an undergraduate degree, the maximum number of overall course repeats is six (6). For the purposes of counting the overall repeat maximum, neither grades of W or CW count.
If you have exhausted six (6) repeats, you must either meet with the department of your current major to receive permission to continue in the major or declare a new major. If declaring a new major, you must select a major that can be completed without incurring additional repeats. Be aware that the maximum number of six (6) repeats is not reset when your major is changed.
Exceptions to the Repeat Count:
• Regular session courses dropped within the first ten (10) days of the semester are excluded from the course repeat maximum (see the Academic Calendar for drop deadlines for other sessions).
• Courses that can be taken multiple times for additional credit (per the university catalog) are also excluded from the course repeat maximum.
• Practicum, internship, project, thesis, dissertation, independent studies, and student teaching may not be repeated to improve a grade.
• Grades of W (student withdrew from the course) and grades of CW (student completely withdrew from all classes that semester) are not considered an earned grade.
• Courses repeated at other institutions prior to transfer are excluded from the overall course repeat maximum.
• Repeat maximums in a first undergraduate degree do not apply to a second undergraduate degree. If you are completing a second undergraduate degree, you are allowed a new repeat maximum of six (6) courses.
• Remedial courses (e.g., MUS-APL010, THEA010) are excluded from the registration maximum.
If you repeat a course, only the most recent repeated course may count toward a degree; all grades will appear on the Boise State transcript including grades of 
W or CW.
Your grade-point average (GPA) is affected by repeating courses. When you repeat a course, both grades appear on your transcript. Note:
• Courses repeated prior to Fall 1995 use a grade replacement policy. Only the most recent grade was used in calculating the cumulative GPA.
• Courses repeated Fall 1995 through Summer 2001 used a gradeaveraging policy. Courses repeated during this period will be averaged, using both grades in the calculation of the GPA.
• Beginning Fall 2001, courses repeated will use a grade replacement policy. Only the most recent grade will be used in calculation of the cumulative GPA.
Grade Exclusion
You may petition to exclude from GPA calculation any grades earned at Boise State or at another institution in one or two semesters in which your GPA is less than 2.00. You must complete a Request for Grade Exclusion form and meet all the following criteria:
• You must not have been a student at any institution of higher education for at least five years, or at least eight years must have elapsed since you received the grades you wish to have excluded.
• After being readmitted and before applying for grade exclusion, you must complete 12 credits at Boise State with a GPA of 2.50 or higher, or 24 credits with a GPA of 2.25 or higher.
• You have not previously been granted grade exclusion twice at Boise State.
If you request grade exclusion, you must have all grades excluded in the semester or semesters chosen; you may not choose individual grades. If you wish to exclude grades from two semesters, you may apply multiple times as long as you have not exceeded the maximum number of semesters to exclude. All grades, past and present, will remain on your transcript, but the excluded grades will not count toward graduation or be calculated in your GPA. 
GRADES
However, all grades, including those that have been excluded, will be used to calculate graduation honors. If you possess a post-secondary degree or certificate, you may not have any grades earned prior to receiving that degree or certificate excluded from your GPA. Grade exclusion may affect your financial aid; contact the Financial Aid Office for details, boisestate.edu/financialaid/.
Academic Standing/Probation and Dismissal
To remain in good academic standing, you must maintain a minimum gradepoint average (GPA) for the number of credits you have earned. Table 5.2 shows the minimum Boise State GPA (Boise State GPA only, transfer and test GPA not included) you must have in relation to the total cumulative credits earned (includes transfer, test, and Boise State credits) for determining probation or dismissal status. 
Table 5.2
Minimum Boise State GPA Necessary to Remain in Good Academic StandingCumulative Credits EarnedMinimum Boise State Cumulative GPA0 to 251.7526 or more2.00If you fail to maintain the minimum Boise State GPA shown in Table 5.2, you are placed on probation. At the end of your next semester at Boise State, the university reviews your record and takes one of the following actions:
• removes you from probation (if your cumulative Boise State GPA is at or above the minimum specified in Table 5.2),
• continues your probation (if your cumulative Boise State GPA is below the minimum specified in Table 5.2, but your semester GPA is 2.0 or higher), or
• dismisses you from the university (if your cumulative Boise State GPA is below the minimum specified in Table 5.2 and your semester GPA is below 2.0).
If you leave the university while on probation, you will remain on probation when you return—even if you have attended another institution in the meantime. While on probation, you may be ineligible to receive financial aid or to participate in extracurricular activities sponsored by the university. For more information on these restrictions, see Chapter 7—Financial Aid and the Dean of Students website, boisestate.edu/deanofstudents/.
If you are dismissed from the university, you are unable to enroll for one semester (fall or spring) after the first dismissal and for one academic year after the second dismissal. If you wish to appeal this waiting period, you must file an appeal with the University Academic Appeals Committee. The Academic Appeals Form is at boisestate.edu/registrar/student-forms/. You will be permitted no more than two reinstatements. As per Idaho State Board of Education policy, third dismissal is final.

Chapter 6—Tuition and FeesThis chapter defines the current tuition and fees for attending Boise State University and provides other information about tuition and fees, including deadlines, payment plans, and the senior-citizen rate. Also included in this chapter are some of the more commonly asked questions about Idaho residency requirements.
Deadlines for Paying Tuition, Fees, and Other Charges
You are expected to pay all tuition, fees, and other charges by the deadline specified in the current Academic Calendar. If you register after the deadline, you will be expected to pay all tuition, fees, and other charges when you register. You may pay with an electronic check or credit/debit card.
Access your student account on myBoiseState (my.boisestate.edu/) to find out deadlines for paying tuition, fees, and other charges. Boise State does not mail out paper statements. Log in to myBoiseState (my.boisestate.edu/), select Student Center, then select the Student Financials tile. Please contact Student Financial Services, Administration Building, Room 101 or call (208) 426-1212, for specific fee information. Other financial information is available on the Student Financials website at boisestate.edu/sfs/.
Deferred Payment of Tuition, Fees, and Other Charges
If you are unable to pay tuition and fees before the deadline established in the current Academic Calendar, you may be able to pay your fees in three equal installments. To do so, you must be registered for two or more billable credits, and must not have delinquent or past-due accounts with the university.
To enroll in the fee payment plan, complete the request on myBoiseState 
(my.boisestate.edu/). Select Student Center, then select the Student Financials tile, select Enroll in Payment Plan, select Charges Due from the options on the left, click on Make a Payment to be taken to Transact, our payment processor. The payment processor will open in a new tab or window. If nothing happens, please check your browser settings and enable popups, select Payment Plans from the menu on the left.. At the time of the submission, your fees will be split into three equal installments. The installments will be due on or before August 25, September 25, and October 25 for the fall semester and on or before January 25, February 25, and March 25 for the spring semester. A $30 enrollment fee will be charged to use the plan. For more information concerning the fee payment plan, visit Student Financial Services, Administration Building, Room 101, or call (208) 426-1212.
The fee payment plan must be submitted before the fee payment deadline to avoid the $50 penalty. In the event that you withdraw from school or are administratively withdrawn after the refund period, any balance owing on the installment plan will be immediately due and payable.
Note: Delinquent balances will be assessed a late charge of 1.75% per month or $10.00, whichever is greater, and you will forfeit any opportunity to defer payment in the future.
If financial aid arrives before your fee payment plan is repaid, the financial aid will be applied to the amount owed. This application of financial aid takes precedence over any other method of repayment. If you defer payment and then withdraw from the university, Boise State will deduct the amount owed on your account from any refund you may be eligible to receive. You will also be charged a $40.00 complete withdrawal fee.
If your tuition, fees or other charges remain unpaid, you may be sent to an outside collection agency and will be responsible for any additional collections fees.
How Boise State Calculates Your Tuition and Fees
Your actual cost to attend Boise State depends on how many classes you take, the type of classes you take, and your status as a resident or nonresident student. In addition to these fees, you may also have to pay such additional charges as workshop fees, e-textbook fees, or materials charges, depending on the type of classes you take. 
When you apply for admission to Boise State, you pay a one-time, nonrefundable fee ($50.00) for processing your application. All degree-seeking and readmitted students are also required to pay a New Student Curriculum Fee ($175.00). To calculate your other tuition and other fees, Boise State uses a milestone of eleven credits per semester. Once you register for 11 or more credits, you are required to pay the full tuition and fees shown in Table 6.1, below. See Student Financials website for the most current tuition and fee information at boisestate.edu/sfs/. 
Table 6.1
Tuition and Fees, Per Semester, for Fall 2023 and Spring 2024, UndergraduateTuition and FeesResidentNonresidentFull Tuition and Fees (11-16 credits)$4, 524.00$13,551.91Partial Tuition and Fees (1-10 credits)$411.56 per credit hour$855.4 per credit hourTuition per credit hour over 16 hours$252.00 per credit hour$252.00 per credit hourIn determining whether you have reached the milestone of 11 credits per semester, Boise State counts all credit hours on your registration form, including credit hours under audit status, credit hours for courses you are repeating, and credit hours for workshops. In short, nearly every combination of any type of credit hour counts toward that 11-credit milestone. Please note, also, that developmental courses (such as THEA010 Theatre Symposium) count as 1 credit each toward the 11-credit milestone, even though you earn no credits by taking the course, see Table 6.2.
Note: Tuition, fees, and other charges are subject to change at any time by the Idaho State Board of Education, acting as the Board of Trustees for Boise State.
Noncredit Bearing Courses
The following is a list of noncredit bearing courses with the amount of credit each is equivalent to for fee purposes: 
Table 6.2
Credit Equivalent for Noncredit Bearing CoursesIEPATH0313IEPATH0413IEPATH0474IEPATH0324IEPATH0424MUS-APL0101IEPATH0334IEPATH0434THEA0101IEPATH0363IEPATH0441IEPATH0374IEPATH0463Other Fees and Charges
Note: Fees are calculated based on the courses you are registering for. If you enroll in private music lessons, you pay a music fee according to the schedule shown in Table 6.3.
Table 6.3
Fees for Private Music Lessons1 Credit2 Credits4 Credits$200$400$400Section 103 Compliance Policy (Veterans' Benefits and Transition Act)
The Veterans Benefits and Transition Act of 2018, Section 103, effective August 
1, 2019 requires Students using U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Post 9/11 G.I. Bill® (Ch. 33) or Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (Ch. 31) to register for classes, submit a G.I. Bill® Declaration and VA Certificate of Eligibility (COE) for entitlement (or the equivalent award letter) to the Boise State University Veteran Services Center link at boisestate.edu/veterans/veterandependent-declaration-of-semester-benefits-form/. This must be done no later than two business days prior to the initial tuition bill deadline for the semester requesting education benefits.
These students will not be restricted in any way for 90 days from the tuition bill deadline, if payment has not been received due to a delay in receipt of benefits from the VA. After the 90 days, the university will review each student on a case by case basis. The student is responsible for payment of any tuition balance not covered by their VA education benefit by the appropriate deadlines.
According to VA, the University may not require a student to use his or her federal financial aid, or other sources of payment for tuition and fees while it awaits VA payments within the 90-day period. Students may choose, however, to utilize federal financial aid, or any sort of aid or loan for tuition/fees during the interim period if the student wishes to do so. Please contact Student Financial Services, Administration Building, Room 101 or call (208) 426-1212.
Idaho Senior Citizen’s Fee Reduction
If you are an Idaho resident and are at least 65 years old, you are eligible to audit courses, on a space available basis, at no per credit charge. You will be responsible for any related special course fees (e.g., lab, online, private music, workshop, e?textbook fee). See Chapter 4 Registration Policies and Procedures, Credit/Audit Status for information on auditing courses. Not all programs are eligible for this rate. If you choose to register on a graded basis and earn academic credit, this rate does not apply and you will be assessed regular tuition and fees. For more information, contact Student Financial Services. All payment deadlines apply.
Refund Policy
In general, if you completely withdraw from Boise State on or before the tenth day of the semester for regular session classes, you are eligible to receive a full refund of the money you paid to register (less a nonrefundable $40.00 complete withdrawal fee). If you withdraw after the tenth day of classroom instruction, you receive no refund. See the Academic Calendar in this catalog for deadlines of the other sessions. No refunds for private music lessons can be granted after the first five days of classroom instruction.
Note: In determining whether you have met the deadline and are therefore eligible for a refund, Boise State considers only the date on which you officially withdraw—not the date on which you stopped attending class. Please note, also, that registering late has no effect on refund deadlines; Boise State cannot extend the deadlines to take into account a late registration. In summary, you must completely withdraw from the university no later than the tenth day of classroom instruction for regular session classes. See the Academic Calendar Deadlines by Session table in this catalog for deadlines of the other sessions.
This general refund policy applies to full-time and part-time students regularly enrolled at the time of the withdrawal. However, the policy may not necessarily govern refunds for short courses, workshops, and continuing education classes. Because refund policies for such classes may vary, you should direct any request for a refund to the academic unit or organization offering the class. In some circumstances, you may be expecting a full refund of tuition and fees, yet receive less than the amount you have paid to Boise State. If you owe money to the university, it will be deducted from the refund before it is issued. Similarly, Boise State will take a deduction from the refund check if you used financial aid to pay all or part of room-and-board costs, tuition, or registration charges. In such cases, Boise State reimburses the government agency or other organization that furnished the financial aid. Any balance that remains is forwarded to you, usually three to four weeks after you withdraw from the university.
TUITION AND FEES
Information on fee appeals may be obtained in Student Financial Services, Administration Building, Room 101, (208) 426-1212.
Idaho Residence for Tuition Purposes
Initial Determination of Residency Status
When you apply to Boise State, Admissions determines your status as a resident or nonresident for tuition purposes. After you have been admitted, if you have questions about your residency status, please contact the Registrar’s Office at (208) 426-4249.
Procedures to Have Your Residency Status Reviewed
Your legal residence for fee purposes is determined at the time of initial application for admission to Boise State and remains unchanged in the absence of satisfactory written evidence to the contrary. The burden of proof in requesting reclassification to resident status rests with you in providing clear and convincing evidence of residency for tuition purposes as defined by the law. If you are applying to change a nonresident classification from the point of application or are requesting consideration for reclassification based upon satisfying state law, criteria must follow the procedure outlined below:
1. Contact the Residency Coordinator in the Registrar’s Office, Room 110, Administration Building.
2. Complete the Idaho Residency Determination Worksheet and return it to the Residency Coordinator with supporting documentation. A form requesting reclassification to resident status may be filed after qualifying criteria have been satisfied, but no later than 10 school days after the opening of the semester for which the change in status is requested.
3. The Residency Coordinator will determine if you meet the criteria for residency and will notify you in writing of the decision.
4. You may appeal the decision of the Residency Coordinator in writing to the Residency Appeals Committee. To file an appeal the applicant must specify in writing why you believe you have met the criteria and on what basis you should be given residency. The appeal should be turned in to the Residency Coordinator. You will be notified in writing of the decision of the Residency Appeals Committee.
5. If you contest the determination of the Residency Appeals Committee that you are not a qualified resident, you may petition the State Board of Education for review. The petition must be submitted to the President of Boise State University in writing and must set forth your reasons for contesting the decision. The President will submit the petition to the Executive Director of the Office of the state Board of Education who will determine whether the Board or the Board’s designated representatives will hear the appeal. If the Board decides to hear the appeal, it will set forth the scope of review and notify you of the time, date, and place of the hearing. The decision of the Board is final and binding on all parties concerned. You must agree to the release of information to the review body and must comply with deadlines established by the institution for requesting an appeal.
Relevant Law and Regulations
The statutory and regulatory provisions relevant to residency determinations may be found at:
• Idaho Code Section 33-3717B (institutions other than community colleges)

Chapter 7—Financial Aid and ScholarshipsThe Financial Aid Office provides information, guidance, education, and support for you and your family while applying for federal aid and seeking other sources of financial assistance while pursuing a higher education. It is expected that you, and your family, will first contribute to the cost of education through your own resources. Need-based aid, such as grants, loans, and part-time employment are available to help fill the gap between your financial resources and educational expenses. Scholarships are available to you if you have demonstrated academic merit or skill in a particular area of interest or discipline of study.
The information contained in this publication reflects current procedures and rules affecting the delivery of financial aid. Boise State University reserves the right to change, at any time, schedules, rules, and regulations. Appropriate notice of such changes is given, whenever possible, before they become effective. More information is available at: boisestate.edu/financialaid/. General information is also available through the U.S. Department of Education at studentaid.gov.
The following sections describe the eligibility requirements for receiving federal aid, the types of financial aid available at Boise State, procedures for distributing aid, and procedures for applying for financial aid. The rights and responsibilities of students who receive financial aid are included within the following information.

Sources of Financial Aid
Pell Grant
The foundation for financial aid is the Federal Pell Grant, a federal grant available to undergraduate students with documented financial need. Pell Grants range from $800 to $7,395 for eligible full-time students. Pell Grants are also available to most 
Pell-eligible part-time students. Some Pell recipients also qualify for the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG). If you meet the priority filing deadlines, you will be among the first to be considered for the SEOG grant (see “How to Apply for Financial Aid” on page 36).
William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans
Long-term loans are available to undergraduate and graduate students who are enrolled at least half-time. There are two types of Direct Loans: subsidized and unsubsidized. Borrowers of unsubsidized loans are responsible for the interest accrued while attending school. Based on federal regulations, the Financial Aid Office will determine which loan(s) you may be eligible to receive. First time recipients of a Direct Loan must complete an online loan entrance counseling session before Boise State releases loan funds. In addition, you must complete an exit loan counseling session when you graduate or withdraw from the university. 
All Direct Loan borrowers must also complete an online Master Promissory Note, which will be valid for borrowing during subsequent semesters. Repayment of a Direct Loan begins six months after you graduate or six months after your enrollment drops below half-time. Several different repayment plans exist for students to consider. Students are encouraged to discuss repayment plans with their loan servicer. Please see the exit counseling information link on the following website for more information: boisestate.edu/financialaid/home/ types-of-aid/loans/loan-counseling/. The interest rate is set annually in June for the upcoming aid year.
Work-Study
The Federal Work-Study Program provides employment opportunities for selected undergraduate and graduate students with demonstrated financial need. The Atwell J. Parry Idaho Work-Study Program also provides employment opportunities for students; only Idaho residents are eligible to participate in the program. Additional requirements and more detail regarding work-study is available at: boisestate.edu/financialaid/home/types-of-aid/.
Scholarships
Many students fund part of their education with scholarships, which may be awarded for academic achievement, special skills or talent, or because of the recipient’s financial need. Scholarship deadlines vary; for the most current information, please review the different scholarship programs at: boisestate.edu/ scholarships/. All new freshmen and incoming transfer students who have completed the admission application by the deadline and who have at least a 3.2 GPA will be automatically considered for some merit scholarships.
Applying for Scholarships
Many scholarship decisions are based on information contained in your admissions application, or if you are a continuing student, your academic record. However, some scholarships require a separate application. A complete listing of scholarship information is available at boisestate.edu/scholarships/. Students who don’t meet the citizenship or eligible non-citizenship criteria for the FAFSA may still be eligible for need-based scholarships.

June 1: Recommended final date to submit FAFSA application and all documents and other information requested by the Financial Aid Office to ensure that your financial aid will be available for the first disbursement of fall semester. Submitting documents after the June 1st deadline may result in financial aid being unavailable at the time fall tuition is due.
If you miss these deadlines, you may still apply for federal aid. However, processing of FAFSA applications received after the deadlines may not be completed in time for aid availability by fee payment deadline or when classes begin.
4. Applying for Summer Aid
Most financial aid is offered for use during the fall and spring semester(s). However, Pell Grant eligible students can receive up to 150% of their scheduled Pell offer each year. If a student received a Pell grant in fall and/ or spring, they may qualify for a Pell Grant in the summer. 
To be eligible, students must:
	?	Have a completed current FAFSA.
	?	Be Pell Grant eligible.
	?	Be meeting Satisfactory Academic progress (SAP).
?	Have lifetime Pell grant eligibility remaining at the end of the spring term.

To easily find financial aid updates click on the Financial Aid Recipients link on your myBoiseState (my.boisestate.edu/) account. Information is updated regularly on policy changes or other important information that might affect your financial aid. You can also follow the Boise State Financial Aid Facebook page to receive updates.
How Financial Aid is Distributed
The Financial Aid Office begins offering aid for the following academic year beginning in February for new students and March for transfer and continuing students. You should check your myBoiseState (my.boisestate.edu/) account regularly for financial aid information and updates.
Student Financial Services asks for students to grant permission, via a Student Center To Do Item, to allow your financial aid to pay miscellaneous charges on your student account, such as e-textbook fees, parking permit fees, and university health service charges. Granting permission will simplify the billing and payment process. If you do not grant permission by the settlement due date, your financial aid will not be applied to all charges and late fees may be assessed.
Financial aid is first applied to your outstanding registration fees for the current semester, then any current university housing charges. Any remaining financial aid is then refunded to you. (If you have a past due balance for fall and expect a refund for spring, your refund will first be applied to allowable educational costs from fall. The same is true if you have a past due balance from spring and expect a refund for summer. ) If you have signed up for direct deposit, the refund will be electronically deposited to your bank account about three business days after your aid is applied, depending on your banking institution. Otherwise a check will be mailed to your mailing address as shown on your myBoiseState (my.boisestate.edu/) account. Electronic deposit or mailing of refunds continues throughout the semester, if your financial aid should be disbursed after the term begins.
Enrollment
Establishing Eligibility
Your financial aid is based not only upon the credits in which you enroll, but also the courses you actually attend. It is expected that you at least initiate attendance for all classes in which you are enrolled past the add/drop period, even if you later withdraw from that class. If you remain enrolled in a class that you never attended, your aid eligibility will be recalculated for the term, and you will be required to repay any funding for which you are not eligible. Only faculty can confirm whether a student initiated attendance in a course, which may require a record of an assignment submitted or the completion of a test or quiz.
Any change in your enrollment status may affect your ability to maintain satisfactory academic progress (see “Satisfactory Academic Progress” below) and it may also affect aid previously disbursed.
Pell grant eligibility is based on your total enrollment on the last day to drop without a W for the regular session. If you enroll in a session that begins after the 10th day of the semester, your Pell grant eligibility will be reevaluated again on the last day to drop without a W of the 3rd 5-week session. Late enrollment cannot be considered for Pell grant eligibility.
The majority of Boise State scholarships are offered for one year and require fulltime enrollment (12 credits undergraduate, 9 credits graduate) each semester the award is granted. Scholarships are typically split evenly between fall and spring semesters. These splits are nonnegotiable and non-enrollment or enrollment in less than full-time in either semester will result in the forfeiture of that portion of your award. The award messages attached to your scholarship will inform you of all requirements and the scholarship length.
Please make yourself familiar with Scholarship Policies located on the Scholarship website, which contains pertinent information regarding your awards. By accepting a Boise State scholarship, you are permitting the University to release relevant information to scholarship donors and/or the news media.
Partial Withdrawals
Adjustments may be made to your financial aid eligibility if enrollment changes after disbursement of aid has occurred. You may be required to repay a portion of the aid disbursed to you or to your account.
Complete Withdrawals
In general, students receive no refund of fees if they withdraw from the university after the tenth day of classroom instruction. Federal financial aid regulations state that eligibility for aid be recalculated whenever a student withdraws from Boise State, either officially or unofficially. The recalculation determines the amount of aid a student has “earned,” by prorating according to the percent of the term completed before withdrawing. For example, a student who withdraws after completing only 30 percent of the term will have “earned” only 30 percent of original aid eligibility. A student who completes more than 60 percent of the term is considered to have “earned” 100 percent of their aid eligibility.
Once a student officially withdraws, the Financial Aid Office will determine what, if anything, is owed and will provide notification of adjustments to financial aid funding. For more information, including examples of calculations, go to: boisestate.edu/financialaid/home/impacts-on-aid/ enrollment-impacts/complete-withdrawal/ and review the Complete Withdrawal Policy. If you have questions after reviewing that information, please contact the Financial Aid Office.
Unofficial Withdrawals
Students who receive failing grades for all graded courses within a semester are, for financial aid purposes, considered to have unofficially withdrawn from that semester. Students who unofficially withdraw without attending classes may be required to repay all aid disbursed for the semester. Students who attend only a portion of the semester will have their aid eligibility recalculated according to the description under the “complete withdrawals” section above. Please note that if you are determined not to be eligible for any of the aid previously disbursed to your account, you may have a registration hold placed on your record until the balance of aid is repaid to Boise State.
FINANCIAL AID
Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards
Before you receive federal and state financial aid, federal regulations require that you have met and continue to meet some basic academic progress standards. These standards include maintaining a minimum GPA, a limit on the number of credits that may be attempted toward completion of a degree, and that you are on pace to earn a degree within that credit limit. For a complete description of satisfactory standards, please refer to: boisestate.edu/financialaid/home/ impacts-on-aid/sap/.
Satisfactory Academic Progress Review
The university reviews your satisfactory academic progress following the end of each semester. If you fall below any of the minimum standards (as defined in the policy), you will be placed on a financial aid warning for a semester. If, at the end of that semester you are still not meeting satisfactory academic progress standards, you will be ineligible for financial aid or veterans education benefits until you are once again making satisfactory academic progress.
Appeals
If there were extenuating circumstances impacting your ability to meet the Satisfactory Academic Progress standards, you have the right to file a written appeal. Examples of extenuating circumstances include the death of an immediate family member, illness or injury to the student, or similar circumstances. In filing an appeal, you must document any extenuating circumstances that prevented you from making satisfactory academic progress. You must also address how that circumstance has been addressed and will no longer impact your academic progress. Appeal forms may be downloaded at: boisestate.edu/financialaid/home/impacts-on-aid/sap/.
Study Abroad
Federal financial aid is available to qualified students who wish to participate in a study abroad program approved for academic credit by Boise State. You must complete the FAFSA and meet all eligibility requirements pertaining to the federal aid programs.
International Students
If you are an international student and encounter financial difficulties, contact 
International Student Services, Simplot Micron Advising and Success Hub, Room 227, (208) 426-3652. If you are in the United States with a visa or who plan to attend Boise State with the F-1 student visa, you are ineligible for all federal financial aid programs. You may apply for any scholarships that are not federally funded or do not require U.S. citizenship. Scholarship information is available at: boisestate.edu/scholarships/. A limited number of nonresident tuition waivers are available. Continuing students should contact International Student Services for information about these waivers; new international students should contact the International Student Admissions, (208) 426-4367.
Privacy Notice
The Financial Aid Office will release no information to your parents, your spouse, or any other individual without first obtaining your written permission. If you wish to give your permission to release this information, you may obtain a release form from the Registrar’s Office or online at boisestate.edu/registrar/home/studentforms/.

For more information about the different LLC options please visit boisestate.edu/ housing/llp/living-learning-communities/.
In an LLC, students live with other students (and even a professor) who are often in their college and may be taking some of the same classes.

Spaces are limited so prospective students are encouraged to apply online at boisestate.edu/housing/ as soon as possible.

You will gain the ability to view your academic field from new perspectives; see and experience what you are studying at a personal level, enhance your cross-cultural communication skills, increase your self-awareness, and expand your understanding of the U.S. and your culture. Additionally, graduates with global experiences tend to have a distinct advantage in the job market.

Mathematics Requirement
Because the ability to think quantitatively is a characteristic of an educated person, Boise State requires you to demonstrate proficiency in mathematics. All students seeking a baccalaureate degree or an associate degree must complete 3-4 credits in mathematics.
Mathematics Placement Policy
The Right Math Class online assessment: Math Placement at Boise State begins with an online assessment, where you provide information regarding previously taken math courses and tests (SAT/ACT/AP/IB/CLEP), your academic background, and belief in your math abilities. This assessment will provide an initial category as a starting point for math placement. Every student will receive the Right Math Class online assessment and you must complete it prior to your initial advising appointment. For recent high school graduates, please have a copy of your high school transcript available when taking the survey. Accuracy is important to provide math placement that supports your success. Access the Right Math Class online assessment at boisestatemath.thewriteclass.org.
At the end of the online assessment, you will receive a placement category (see table 10.3) and information to discuss with your advisor or the math department to improve placement.
ACT/SAT are for placement only. If you completed the ACT/SAT, you may use the math subtest score if the ACT/SAT math placement score places you in a higher category.
Accuplacer Placement Exams Boise State uses an “adaptive” computerized exam that covers up to four areas of mathematics: pre-algebra, algebra, college algebra, and trigonometry. The areas covered will depend on your background and your performance as the exam proceeds.
The exam is untimed and the number of questions you will be given will vary due to the adaptive nature of the exam, but you should generally allow about an hour. Your exam will be scored immediately and you will be given a printout of your results telling you which classes you are permitted to take.
An exam fee is payable to Proctoring and Certification Center, Chrisway Annex, 1406 Chrisway Dr., at the time you take the exam. Photo ID is required. Personal checks are not accepted.

University Foundations
Philosophy of University Foundations
Boise State’s University Foundations curriculum offers an integrated, sequential learning experience that illustrates the university’s commitment to undergraduate education from entrance to graduation. The curriculum’s distinctive features will help you to achieve academic excellence. University Foundations courses constitute a coherent framework on which departments establish the educational opportunities specific to the needs of their disciplines. From the time you enter the university, you will encounter skilled and motivated faculty members in courses that feature diverse opportunities for examination of historical, intellectual, and ethical traditions. Courses focus on inquiry central to a university education, creating opportunities to explore important subjects, ask questions, debate ideas, increase understanding, research, innovate, and solve problems.
The emphasis is on building a foundation for both advanced study and lifelong learning. Courses in the University Foundations curriculum have clearly articulated goals (University Learning Outcomes) and a built-in process for robust assessment that fosters ongoing improvement. A complete description of University Foundations may be found at boisestate.edu/academics-uf/.
University Learning Outcomes
The university learning outcomes (ULOs) listed below ensure you will be repeatedly exposed to the essential skills sought in college graduates as well as the disciplinary outcomes important for breadth of learning. These outcomes were developed by the faculty to provide undergraduates with a common experience aimed at both unifying the university’s diverse student body and expanding your awareness of yourself and your world. Every Boise State graduate is expected to have met these ULOs, regardless of major or baccalaureate degree.
University Learning Outcomes–Interdisciplinary
• Written Communication—Write effectively in multiple contexts, for a variety of audiences.
• Oral Communication—Communicate effectively in speech, both as speaker and listener.
• Critical Inquiry—Engage in effective critical inquiry by defining problems, gathering and evaluating evidence, and determining the adequacy of argumentative discourse.
• Ethics—Analyze ethical issues in personal, professional, and civic life and produce reasoned evaluations of competing value systems and ethical claims.
• Diversity—Apply knowledge of diversity to address social issues of local, regional, national, and/or global importance.
University Learning Outcomes–Disciplinary
• Mathematics (FM)—Develop an understanding of mathematical 
reasoning processes and the ability to utilize these processes to solve college-level mathematical problems.
• Natural, Physical, and Applied Sciences (FN)—Adhere to a selfcorrecting system of inquiry (the scientific method) and rely on empirical evidence to describe, understand, and predict natural phenomena.
• Arts (FA)—Apply knowledge and methods characteristic of the visual and performing arts to explain and appreciate the significance of aesthetic products and creative activities.
• Humanities (FH)—Apply knowledge and the methods of inquiry characteristic of humanities disciplines to interpret and produce texts expressive of the human condition.
• Social Sciences (FS)—Apply knowledge and the methods of inquiry characteristic of the social sciences to explain and evaluate human behavior and institutions.
The interdisciplinary ULOs focus on the skills developed throughout the academic career and in multiple courses and contexts. After exposure to these learning outcomes in early courses, you will revisit them in greater depth throughout your college experiences and academic programs.
The disciplinary ULOs associated with disciplinary course clusters represent multiple perspectives to be encountered during your academic career. Courses are aligned with the Foundations of the Discipline clusters that best match the learning outcomes naturally associated with that course.
Boise State’s ULOs were inspired by the AAC&U’s “LEAP” framework.
University Foundations Requirements
I. Foundations of Written Communication (ENGL101 and ENGL102)
This two semester, six-credit sequence provides an introduction to the university’s expectations about academic writing and research. The program is coordinated by the First-Year Writing Program. You will be placed in appropriate courses based on test scores. See College First-Year Writing Requirement in this chapter for details.
II. University Foundations (UF) Courses
• Courses with a UF (University Foundations) prefix introduce a diversity of intellectual pursuits, encourage a critical stance toward learning, and equip you with university-level analytic and communication skills.
• Foundations of Intellectual Life (UF 100) is a three-credit course offered as a large general session in combination with a small- format discussion section (~25 students) which focuses on what it means to investigate and discuss intellectual questions at the university level. Sections of the course are organized around different central themes listed in the course schedule for each semester. The course supports Critical Inquiry and Oral Communication and should be taken within your first 30 credits.
• Should you transfer to Boise State with 26 or more earned academic credits from another college or university, you may place into UF200 if those credits include at least three courses equated as Foundation Discipline courses from different fields that apply toward the University Foundations disciplinary core certification requirements and have a grade of C- or higher. Concurrent credits taken at Boise State are not considered transfer credits; the credits may count towards major degree completion.
• Foundations of Ethics and Diversity (UF 200) is a three-credit sophomore-level course that engages you in topics connected to ethics and diversity. Sections of the course are organized around different central themes listed in the course schedule for each semester. We keep the classes small (~ 30 students) to support active learning, meaningful discussion, and connecting the course theme to issues and activities in our larger community. The course emphasizes Written Communication, Ethics and Diversity. Prerequisites: ENGL102, UF100, and sophomore status. Should be taken within your first 60 credits.
III. Foundations of the Discipline (FD)
All students are required to take a number of Foundations of the Discipline courses (see degree table for specific requirements). These courses are offered by academic departments and designed to expose nonmajors to the distinctive methods and perspectives of a disciplinary cluster. The distribution requirements for Foundations of the Discipline courses reflect the belief of the faculty and the Idaho State Board of Education that a major purpose of undergraduate education is to prepare graduates to fulfill the responsibilities of a citizen and to understand and appreciate diverse approaches to information and values. Foundations of the Discipline courses are listed in Table 10.4 and are identified with the word Foundations in the course description. Some departments and programs require specific Foundations of the Discipline courses.
IV. Foundations of Oral Communication (FC) Courses
You must successfully complete a Foundations of Oral Communication (FC) course. FC courses focus on Oral Communication, providing an introduction to the university’s expectations for effective speaking and listening.

Academic Advising at Boise State
Academic advisors help students achieve their educational and career goals through exploration and development of their academic skills, values, and priorities.
Academic advising at Boise State includes:
• ongoing contact with informed and supportive professional, faculty, and peer advisors;
• required advising appointments for first-semester students prior to registration for second-semester courses;
• degree planning, including introduction to and explanation of academic requirements, policies, and procedures;
• referrals to student-support resources;
• exploration of academic skill-building resources and success strategies for timely graduation; and
• examination of the relationship between academic major and career goals. Academic advising services at Boise State are available through three primary sources: the Advising and Academic Support Center (AASC), college- and program-based advising offices, and department faculty. 
Academic advising services at Boise State are available through three primary sources: the Advising and Academic Support Center (AASC), college- and program-based advising offices, and department faculty. 
AASC provides direct academic advising services (major exploration, course scheduling, and interventions for academic difficulties) and academic success programming (academic coaching, Learning Assistants, tutoring resources). AASC’s advising services focus on undeclared students, students exploring potential new majors, Interdisciplinary Studies (IDS) majors, students seeking a sole associates degree, and those experiencing academic challenges. AASC academic support services are open to all undergraduate students regardless of class level or degree program.
College-based advising offices partner with academic departments to provide advising services to majors within the college. Depending on the department, faculty academic advising tends to focus on upper-division students, however, faculty are available to all students for ongoing guidance and mentorship within their disciplines.
Students with a declared major will meet with an advisor in their college or department. To view advising contacts by major, go to boisestate.edu/aasc/findadvisor/contacts/ or log into your myBoiseState Student Center (my.boisestate.edu/) and locate your advisor by clicking on the My Academics link. Click the details link for contact information.
How to Connect with Your Academic Advisor
All new students are assigned an academic advisor. Undeclared students will meet with major exploration advisors at AASC. Please visit boisestate.edu/aasc/ explore-change-majors/, call (208) 426-4049, or email academic@boisestate.edu to make an appointment.
Students with a declared major will meet with an advisor in their college or department. To view advising contacts by major, go to boisestate.edu/aasc/findadvisor/contacts/ or log into your myBoiseState Student Center (my.boisestate.edu/) and locate your advisor on the right side of the page. Click the details link for contact information.
Degree Tracker
Helping you graduate in a timely manner is one of Boise State’s highest priorities. Degree Tracker is a planning tool available in the Student Center to assist you and your advisor in sequencing courses toward degree completion. Degree Tracker presents a personalized academic plan based on your major and transcript. The entire academic path is mapped out, from day one to graduation. You and your advisor have the same ability to access and update information in your Degree Tracker profile via your Student Center on myBoiseState (my.boisestate.edu/). Please refer to the Academic Advisement Report (AAR) and the Registrar’s Office as the authoritative sources to ensure all requirements are met in order to successfully complete degree requirements. For more information, visit boisestate.edu/registrar-help/degree-tracker-students/. If you are not able to access Degree Tracker from your Student Center, please contact the Registrar’s Office at (208) 426-4249 or at regmail@boisestate.edu.
Additional Baccalaureate Degrees and Certificates
If you have earned a baccalaureate degree, either at Boise State or elsewhere, you must complete at least 30 additional upper-division credits for each additional degree you wish to earn. Those 30 credits must be earned at Boise State. In addition, you must meet all the course requirements in your major and any other university requirements. The Interdisciplinary Professional Studies BA degree completion program and the general Associate of Arts or Associate of Science are unavailable for students seeking additional bachelor’s degrees.
To determine what requirements you need to complete, take a copy of your transcript(s) to the department chair of your major. The chair will review your transcript(s) and compile a list of courses you must complete at Boise State to earn the additional degree. Your major may require that the dean of the college also approve this list. Send that list to the graduation evaluators in the Registrar's Office. You do not have to meet the University Foundations Program requirements (for details, see page 47), though you may have to take specific University Foundations courses required for your major. 
At least seven of the credits you take for a certificate program must be completed at Boise State after earning your prior degree or certificate, in order to meet the residency requirement.
Note: If you already have a baccalaureate degree and you are pursuing graduate studies, you must apply for admission to Boise State through the Graduate College, Riverfront Hall, Room 307, (208) 426-3903. If you already have a baccalaureate degree and will be taking undergraduate courses, you need to apply through Admissions, located on the first floor of the Student Union Building, (208) 426-1156.
Admission to Upper-Division
To enroll in upper-division courses (those numbered 300 to 499), you must have completed all course prerequisites and have met all other requirements of your department or college. In most instances, you must also have attained junior standing. If you are a sophomore, you may enroll in upper-division courses with the permission of the department, provided that you have completed all course prerequisites. Some academic programs require students to be formally admitted to the major before they may enroll in upper-division courses. To determine if this policy applies to your major, consult the requirements specified for your major in Chapter 12—Academic Programs and Courses.
Catalog Policy
In determining if you have met the requirements to graduate, the Registrar’s Office follows the requirements defined in a single edition of the university catalog. A new catalog is published each year. In some cases, requirements change from one edition to another. You may select any edition of the catalog, provided that the catalog was published and was in force while you were enrolled at Boise State and the catalog is no older than six academic years at the time of your graduation.
If you wish to change your catalog, contact the Registrar’s Office in the 
Administration Building, Room 110, (208) 426-4249 or degreeprogress@boisestate.edu. If you have already applied for graduation and need to change your catalog, email degreeprogress@boisestate.edu.
Course Prerequisite
A prerequisite is a course (or courses) you must have successfully completed before enrolling in another course. For instance, before you can enroll in SPAN102 Elementary Spanish II, you must first have completed SPAN101 Elementary Spanish I. If a course has a prerequisite, the prerequisite is listed in Chapter 12—Academic Programs and Courses or in the online course search. Students must complete prerequisites listed in the catalog descriptions with a grade of C- or better prior to enrolling in the course unless otherwise specified by the department. Requests to waive certain course prerequisites may be approved by the department offering the course. Requests must be justified based on background, education, or experience.
Credit for Prior Learning
Credit for Prior Learning (CPL) is also known as Prior Learning Assessment 
(PLA) or Experiential Learning. Many colleges and universities, including Boise State, accept satisfactory performance on national standardized examinations, satisfactory performance on locally written examinations, or satisfactory evaluation of other training and experience as alternatives by which you may satisfy certain general education, specific course, or major requirements.
You may earn up to one-third of your total credits required for graduation (40 credits for a baccalaureate degree and 20 credits for an associate degree) in a combination of all forms of credit for prior learning (portfolio, challenge, CLEP credit, AP credit, DSST credit, Credit for Prerequisites Not Taken, ACE Guide credit, military credit, etc. ). No more than one-quarter may be earned in portfolio credit (30 credits for a baccalaureate degree and 15 credits for an associate degree). Credits earned through any form of credit for prior learning shall not count toward the 30-credit graduation residency requirement or as a repeat of another course.
Students must be currently enrolled at Boise State to apply for prior learning credits. You can earn credits required for graduation by receiving credit for prior learning in the following ways:
• satisfactory performance on approved national standardized examinations, departmental examinations, or evaluations,
• military training and experience,
• other training programs recognized and evaluated by the American Council on Education, and
• credit granted through a prior learning portfolio (described below).
Specific course equivalencies and credits awarded are determined by academic departments. Credit may be awarded for specific courses or as general elective credit. Boise State will generally follow the guidelines provided by the American Council on Education (ACE) in granting credit for prior learning. Credits awarded through the ACE National Guide recommendations and national standardized tests (CLEP, AP, IB, etc. ) are recorded with a grade of P (Pass) after the tenth day of the first term of enrollment. Credits earned through any form of credit for prior learning may not be used to repeat a class previously graded.
A detailed list of all the types of prior learning for which you may receive credit is available at boisestate.edu/registrar/transfers/prior-learning-credit/. More information about prior learning credit is available through the Registrar’s Office, Administration Building, Room 110, (208) 426-4249.
The following is a brief review of prior learning credit that is available:
• Advanced Placement Exams (AP) are administered nationally each year in May, primarily at participating high schools. The exams are the culminating exercise for high school students taking honors or advanced courses that parallel standard college-level courses. AP scores and Boise State course equivalencies are found online boisestate.edu/registrar/ transfers/prior-learning-credit/.
• The College Level Examination Program (CLEP) consists of general and subject exams in a variety of subject areas. The general exams measure college-level achievement in five areas: English composition, natural 
sciences, social sciences and history, mathematics, and humanities. The subject exams test achievement in more specific college-level subjects.
• DSST Exams allow you to receive college credits for learning acquired outside the traditional classroom. These are similar to CLEP subject exams, which test achievement in college-level subjects.
• GED College Ready + Credit allows you to receive college credit for a 
GED College Ready + Credit (GED+) exam by scoring between 175 and 200 on a test subject and sending your official scores directly from GED or ACE to Boise State University.
• International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme Examinations. The IBO’s Diploma Programme (DP) is a demanding course of study that leads to culminating exams for highly motivated high school students. A minimum score of 4 or higher is required to receive credit.
Course Challenge
If you feel that your background, education, and experience have given you sufficient knowledge in a subject area you may be able to receive credit for a course by passing a challenge exam. Each department selects the courses available for challenge and may develop screening procedures to determine if you are eligible to take the challenge exam. You may not challenge a course to improve a previous grade earned in that course.
After you have completed 12 semester credits at Boise State, and once you have received permission from the appropriate academic department to register for a challenge exam, you must complete the Credit for Prior Learning form and submit it to the Registrar’s Office, Administration Building, Room 110. Fee information is available on the form. For departmentally prepared exams, the department determines the grading system. Grades may be recorded as either a Pass or as a letter grade (A+ through C-). Grades of D+ or lower will not be transcribed. Before you take the exam, the department will tell you what type of grading is available.
Credit for Prerequisites Not Taken
Depending on your background or experience, you may be allowed to take some courses without first taking a prerequisite course. In some cases, you may also be able to receive credit for the prerequisite course. To take a course without first taking the prerequisite, you must obtain the approval of the head of the appropriate academic department. Complete the Credit for Prior Learning form and submit it to the Registrar’s Office, Administration Building, Room 110. Fee information is available on the form. Grading will be done on a Pass/Fail system. Only Pass grades will be transcribed. Grades will be transcribed if/when you complete the advanced course and earn a C- or higher. Academic departments determine which courses can qualify for this credit.
Military Training Credit
You may receive credit for selected military training or experience. To do so, you must provide the Registrar’s Office with a copy of your Joint Services transcript or similar official documents. If you have completed two or more years of active military service, you may also request that the Boise State Military Science department evaluate your military service for possible credit toward the ROTC Basic Course. Credit for the ROTC Basic Course is only awarded to those who have committed to pursuing the ROTC Advanced Course.
Other Training Programs
With Registrar approval, you may earn credit for training programs listed in the ACE National Guide, published by the American Council on Education, acenet.edu/national-guide/.
Prior Learning Portfolio
Credit for prior learning experience is also possible in some departments through the development of a formal, professional, written portfolio. The portfolio outlines, in-depth, the knowledge you have gained outside the college classroom and shows the relationship to college-level learning. The academic department determines the assessment of portfolios and credit recommendations in which the credit is being requested. Fee information is available on the Credit for Prior Learning form. For further information on this process, contact the Registrar’s Office, Administration Building, Room 110, (208) 426-4249. For further information on specific applications, contact the appropriate academic department.
Credit Limitations
BroncoFit Activity Courses
BroncoFit activity courses (BRNCOFIT) are offered by the Department of Kinesiology. The Kinesiology BRNCOFIT Activity Program aims to help students in any major maintain an active lifestyle by providing instruction in various activities designed to encourage lifelong physical activity and exercise. You may count as many as 8 credits of BroncoFit activity courses toward graduation.
Extension and Correspondence Courses
You may count as many as 30 credits of extension or correspondence courses toward graduation. However, your department may further limit the type and number of credits you can count toward your major. If you wish to count an extension or correspondence course toward degree requirements, you must complete the course and have an official transcript sent to the Registrar’s Office by midterm of the semester in which you intend to graduate.
Independent Study
Any department offering a baccalaureate degree may offer independent study, which allows you to pursue a special interest in an area not covered by a regularly offered course. Independent study is designed to complement your major and is not intended to be used to complete requirements for a regularly offered course. You may not use independent study to improve a grade you received in a class. To participate in independent study, you must have attained junior standing and have a GPA of 2.0 or higher. If you are a junior or senior, you may take up to 4 credits of independent study in a semester, though you may take no more than 6 credits in a given academic year. You may apply no more than 9 credits of independent study toward your degree. If you are a freshman or sophomore in the Honors Program, you may take up to 4 credits of independent study in a semester, up to a total of 6 lower-division credits.
Internships
Most departments allow you to participate in internships and receive academic credit for professional experience relevant to your major or field of study. You may apply up to 12 credits of internships toward your graduation requirements. Departments that offer internships have coordinators for these programs. More specific information about internships is available from your department.
Religion Courses
You may count toward graduation as many as 8 credits of nonsectarian religion courses (e.g., Old or New Testament or The Bible as Literature). However, the courses must be taken at accredited colleges or universities, and you may count the credits only as general elective credits.
Service-Learning
Service-learning provides you with a way to link coursework with community projects. When you enroll in a service-learning designated course, you receive course credit participating in service opportunities that are intentionally designed to promote learning and skill development while helping to meet community identified needs. Each year, more than 100 classes offer a servicelearning experience. In most classes, service-learning is fully integrated as a course component (assignment, case study, or project); in other classes it is optional.
Find the service-learning courses being offered, at boisestate.edu/servicelearning/ sl-courses/. Then use your Student Center to search the course prefix, find the service-learning section, and enroll in the service-learning class that you chose. Some classes offer an additional course credit for a Service-Learning Lab (45 hours of course-related service and reflection). In the Class Search Enrollment through the Student Center, the Service-Learning Lab will be designated by the base course prefix and number followed by the suffix SL (e.g., PSYC310 base course; PSYC310SL service learning lab). You may take up to three servicelearning labs in a semester. You may apply no more than 9 service-learning lab credits to your degree.
All service-learning classes use service experiences as the basis for written reflection, discussion, and other assignments. Instructors deliberately link the course content with the service experience in order for students to better understand course content. The service commitment ranges from 10 to 45 hours and how it will be integrated in the course schedule is at the discretion of the instructor. There is no limit to the number of service-learning courses you can take.
For more information, contact the Service-Learning team at (208) 426-1004 or visit the website at boisestate.edu/servicelearning/ for course lists, FAQs, and resources for a successful service-learning experience.
Undergraduate Enrollment in 500-Level Courses
If you are a senior, you may apply up to two 500-level (graduate) courses toward the credit requirements for an undergraduate degree. You may also count these courses toward the 40-credit requirement for upper-division courses. To count 500-level courses toward graduation, complete the form Permit for Seniors to Take Graduate Courses, available online at boisestate.edu/registrar/home/student-forms/.
Undergraduate Research
Any department offering a baccalaureate degree may offer undergraduate research experience for credit, which creates an opportunity for you to investigate a question or concept by gathering and analyzing data and/or engaging in creative scholarly activity. Undergraduate research experience for credit is intended to complement your major, not to cover the content of a regularly offered course. To participate in undergraduate research you must have a GPA of 2.0 or higher. You may apply no more than 9 combined credit hours of independent study and undergraduate research toward your degree.
Workshop Credits
You may apply up to 9 workshop credits toward your graduation requirements. However, your department may further limit the number of workshop credits you may apply toward your major.
Double Majors
You may earn a single baccalaureate degree with more than one major if you satisfy all requirements for each major.
Graduation Honors
You are awarded graduation honors when you receive your first baccalaureate degree, based on the scale shown in Table 10.4 below. Honors are based on all your semesters completed, and your final transcript remains the official record of any honors granted. However, to honor you at commencement, Boise State uses your cumulative grade-point average (GPA) at the end of either spring or summer for the December ceremony and the end of fall for the May ceremony.
Table 10.4 Graduation HonorsCumulative Grade-Point AverageHonor3.500–3.749Cum Laude3.750–3.949Magna Cum Laude3.950–4.000Summa Cum LaudeNote: All grades, including those that have been excluded from GPA calculation in accordance with the grade exclusion policy, will be used to calculate graduation honors. How to Apply for Graduation
Apply for graduation by logging on to your myBoiseState Student Center account. For further instruction on where and how to apply online, see boisestate.edu/registrar-help/apply-graduation/. A non-refundable graduation application fee must be paid when applying. The application fee is $20.00 for each undergraduate degree, undergraduate certificate, and graduate certificate, and $25.00 for master’s/doctoral candidates.

The application deadline is the end of the first week of the semester you intend to graduate (see the Academic Calendar for the exact date). A late fee will be applied after the application deadline of $20.00 for undergraduate degrees, undergraduate certificates, and graduate certificates, and $25.00 for master’s/ doctoral candidates. The last day to apply for graduation with a late fee is the last day of classroom instruction.
To ensure your candidacy, please review your degree information on myBoiseState (my.boisestate.edu/) with your academic advisor. A graduation evaluator will review your Academic Advisement Report (AAR) after you apply to graduate; it takes approximately 6 weeks to review all applications for graduation. Upon review of your application, you will receive an email notifying you of your graduation status. You will be considered a valid candidate if you are enrolled in all outstanding requirements.
Note: All graduating students must pay the graduation application fee, regardless of whether you intend to participate in commencement and regardless of whether you wish to receive a diploma.
Minors and Certificates
Chapter 11—Summary of Programs and Courses lists the certificates and minors available at Boise State and the degrees offered by Boise State. Certificates and minors are available in selected fields, as are endorsements in secondary education programs. Requirements for all certificates, endorsements, and minors are listed in Chapter 12—Academic Programs and Courses.
Notes on minors:
• A minor must be earned with a baccalaureate degree.
• To have a minor officially recorded on your transcript, you must complete all required coursework in that minor before you receive your degree.
• Minors will not appear on your diploma.
• You may not earn a minor in the same field as your major.
• There must be at least 9 credits unique to the minor (e.g., not used by your major).
• Teaching endorsements are awarded by the Idaho State Department of Education and are not recorded on Boise State transcripts.
• Teaching endorsement minors do not certify you to teach. The endorsement for teaching is awarded by the Idaho State Department of Education and a teaching endorsement minor is awarded by Boise State and recorded on Boise State transcripts.
For general degree requirements of minors and certificates, see page 45.
Transferring Credits to Boise State
Transferring credits is a process by which some or all of the credits you have earned at another institution of higher learning are applied toward your degree at Boise State. The Registrar’s Office evaluates your transcript to determine if the courses you have taken elsewhere are equivalent to courses offered at Boise State. If a course you have taken is equivalent, you can count the credits earned in that course toward graduation, just as if you had earned those credits at Boise State. If the course is not equivalent, those credits count as general elective credits. Credits are only transferred if you are seeking your first baccalaureate degree. Boise State accepts college-level academic credit if those credits were granted by one of the seven accrediting institutions listed here: boisestate.edu/registrar/ transfers/transfer-credit-basics/, previously known as regional accreditation. If you earn credits from an institution not listed in the Database of Postsecondary Institutions and Programs, you may still be able to transfer those credits to Boise State. In such cases, the department offering similar courses will review the credits you wish to transfer and decide which credits, if any, to accept.
As a transfer student, you are required to:
• complete a minimum of 15 credits at Boise State for an associate degree
• complete a minimum of 30 upper-division credits at Boise State for a baccalaureate degree.
For purposes of counting lower- or upper-division credit required for graduation, the university uses the level of the transferring institution. If the course is considered lower-division by the transfer institution, it will be considered lower-division at Boise State. If the course is considered upperdivision at the transfer institution, then the course will be counted toward meeting the upper-division requirement for graduation purposes. See General Degree Requirements for details on minimum upper-division credits needed for obtaining a degree.
Core Certification
You may be considered core certified if you:
1. Earned an academic associate degree (not an associate of applied science) one of the seven accrediting institutions (see boisestate.edu/registrar/ transfers/transfer-credit-basics/) and do not exceed Boise State’s policy limit for credit for prior learning.
2. Transfer without an academic associate degree, but meet Idaho State Board of Education General Education Matriculation (GEM) requirements and have a minimum of thirty-six (36) GEM semester credit hours: 
boardofed.idaho.gov/board-policies-rules/board-policies/higher-educationaffairs-section-iii/iii-n-general-education/.
If you are core certified, all foundation discipline requirements except for those courses that are specifically required by the major are considered fulfilled. General University Core Met will appear on your transfer credit report and Academic Advisement Report.

Boise State requires that transcripts from international institutions be evaluated by an academic credential evaluation service before transfer credit is evaluated and posted. There are two options for evaluation:
1. The student orders the evaluation before attending Boise State.
2. Boise State orders the evaluation during the first semester.
Boise State only accepts courses with grades of C- or higher. All courses are transferred in with a grade of Pass. If you have completed the equivalent of a U.S. bachelor’s degree, your transcripts will not be evaluated. Guidelines on international transfer credit, including accepted evaluation companies, can be found on the Registrar’s website: boisestate.edu/registrar/transfers/internationalcredit-evaluation/. If you have questions about the international transfer credit process, contact the Registrar’s Office at (208) 426-4249 or at degreeprogress@boisestate.edu.

How to Read a Course Description
PHYS¹ 111² General Physics³ (3-3-4)4(F, S, SU)5(FN)6. Kinematics, forces and dynamics, conservation laws, waves, thermodynamics. Uses algebra and trigonometry, and includes one required three-hour lab per week. 
Recommended background: high school physics or PHYS101. PREREQ7: 
MATH143 and MATH144 or satisfactory placement score into MATH170.
Course Description Key
Each course at Boise State has a course description that consists of a prefix, course number, title, credit code, semester code, additional information, content description, and list of requisites. These elements of the course description are described below.
1) Course Prefix/Subject The prefix indicates the department or academic unit offering the course. See this chapter for a complete list of course prefixes.
2) Course Numbering System Each course offered is assigned a unique number, indicating what type of course it is and what sort of credits may be earned in the course. Throughout this catalog, you will find courses numbered as follows:
	00–99	noncredit courses that do not count toward degree requirements
	100–199	freshman-level courses (lower-division courses)
	200–299	sophomore-level courses (lower-division courses)
	300–499	junior- and senior-level courses (upper-division courses)
	500–699	graduate-level courses
Ordinarily, courses numbered below 500 carry undergraduate credit. However, the university sometimes grants graduate credit in select upperdivision courses (those numbered 300 through 499). If an upper-division course carries graduate credit, its unique number will be followed by a G (for graduate). Students enrolling in such courses may earn either graduate or undergraduate credit; however, students who wish to earn graduate credit are required to do additional work beyond that required of students earning undergraduate credit.
Throughout the catalog, a hyphen appearing between course numbers indicates that the first numbered course is a prerequisite (PREREQ) to a second numbered course (e.g., ENGL101-102); a comma between course numbers indicates that either course may be taken independently of the other (e.g., HIST111, 112).
Cross-listed courses are courses offered by multiple departments or academic units.
Dual-listed courses are courses offered by an academic unit at both the 400-level and 500-level (e.g., ME432 and ME532).
3) Course Title The official title of the course.
4) Credits According to Idaho State Board of Education policy, forty-five (45) clock-hours of student involvement are required for each semester credit, which includes a minimum of fifteen (15) student contact hours for each semester credit.
The unique course number of each course is followed by a sequence of three numbers that indicate the number of lecture hours per week that the course meets, number of lab hours per week that the course meets, and the number of credits a student earns by completing the course. The 
following examples show typical uses of these additional numbers:
	(3-0-3)	a 3-hour lecture class carrying 3 credits
(3-4-5)	a 3-hour lecture class with a corresponding 4-hour laboratory class, carrying 5 credits
	(0-4-0)	a 4-hour laboratory class that carries no credit
(0-2-1) a 2-hour studio art class or fitness activity class, carrying 1 credit Note: a V is used to indicate variable credits or hours.
5) Semester Offered The semester code indicates the semester(s) and/or term in which the course is offered and is expressed using letter codes F for fall semester, S for spring semester, and SU for summer term, with the full sequence of letter codes enclosed in parentheses. A comma or slash between letter codes is used to interpret combinations as illustrated in the following examples:
Ffall semester onlySspring semester onlySUsummer session onlyF, Sfall and spring semesterF, SUfall semester and summer session onlyS, SUspring semester and summer session onlyF/Sfall semester, spring semester, or bothF/SUfall semester, summer session, or bothS/SUspring semester, summer session, or bothF, S, SUfall semester, spring semester, and summer sessionF/S/SUfall semester, spring semester, or summer sessionIf the semester code is not indicated, then the course is offered during the fall and spring semesters and summer session (although there may be some exceptions).
6) Additional Information Associated with the scheduling of the course or showing the special status of a course (can be used to satisfy university foundations requirements) may be given in parentheses after the semester offered. A course that is not offered regularly may be listed as On Demand, As Justified, or Intermittently.
7) Requisites The list of requisites specifies any prerequisites and/or corequisites using the following abbreviations:
	PREREQ:	prerequisite (condition to be met before enrollment)
	COREQ:	co-requisite (condition met before or during enrollment)
	PERM/INST:	permission of instructor required to enroll
PERM/CHAIR: permission of department chair required to enroll The most common type of prerequisite is a specific course that must be successfully completed prior to enrollment. Typically, a co-requisite is a laboratory course that must be taken during the same semester or term as a related science course.

Department Statement
The undergraduate degree programs in Accountancy are designed to provide you with the necessary knowledge and skills required for entry-level positions in the accounting profession broadly defined. They also provide the knowledge and skills required for entry into graduate business programs. These skills include written and oral communication, analytical reasoning, the ability to use technology, as well as technical accounting skills.
The mission of the Accountancy Department is to provide a high-quality educational experience through student-centered teaching, impactful research, and meaningful service that benefits and challenges students, the accounting profession, the business community, and the community at large.
Consistent with COBE’s values (Relevance, Respect, and Responsibility) we develop well-rounded professionals by:
• delivering a rigorous and relevant curriculum,
• engaging in relevant research and other scholarly endeavors,
• encouraging life-long learning,
• promoting a culture of service, and
• fostering a climate of mutual respect and ethical behavior.
After graduation, students frequently seek to attain professional credentials, such as Certified Public Accountant (CPA), Certified Management Accountant (CMA), and Certified Internal Auditor (CIA). To attain such credentials, candidates must pass rigorous examinations that require hundreds of hours of study and meet various other requirements (e.g., additional education and work experience) as designated by each credentialing organization.
Admission Requirements
Students interested in pursuing a degree in the College of Business and Economics (COBE) must be a pre-business major and complete the COBE admission requirements prior to the declaration of a major in a degree completion program.

Department Statement
For complete advising information, please visit boisestate.edu/biology/.
The bachelor’s degree in biology provides students with the intellectual and technical skills to succeed in a multitude of careers (e.g., medicine, forensics, genetics, laboratory sciences, natural resources management, animal biology, plant biology, etc.). Students gain an understanding of living organisms, of how organisms interact with their environment, and of the process of biological investigation. The curriculum provides students with a knowledge base in molecular, cellular, organismal, ecological, and evolutionary biology, as well as allowing emphasis in the cellular, molecular and biomedical area, the ecology, evolution, and behavior area, and the secondary education field.
Our Pre-Medical, Pre-Dental, Pre-Veterinary, Pre-Chiropractic, and PrePhysician Assistant students who graduate with a degree in biology are highly successful at gaining admission to excellent professional schools, and they typically find themselves better prepared than their cohorts from other institutions. Biology graduates have also been very successful at gaining admission to MS and PhD programs. Other students have begun working in their field immediately after completing their BS degree. Finally, graduates find that the skills developed and knowledge acquired as biology students benefit them in non-biological fields.
The Department of Biological Sciences also offers a BS in Biology, Secondary Education so students may obtain teaching certification and pursue a teaching career at the secondary school level.
A nondegree curriculum in Pre-Forestry and Pre-Wildlife Management allows students to complete coursework at Boise State University before transferring to a program at another institution. Alternatively, one can major in biology at Boise State and pursue coursework to meet education requirements to become a Certified Wildlife Biologist by The Wildlife Society (see wildlife.org/learn/ professional-development-certification/). Many students have secured wildlife and fisheries positions with a biology degree from Boise State.
Acquisition of experience outside the classroom is often important in the pursuit of biological careers. To gain such experience, students may participate in research projects, either assisting faculty or developing student-initiated projects. Undergraduate research can be an exciting intellectual journey. Students may also pursue internships with government agencies, businesses, hospitals, and other professionals in the area.
New Biology Students should take 1) the appropriate mathematics course (determined by placement exam) in their first semester at Boise State, 2) begin course sequences in biology and chemistry as soon as possible, 3) obtain academic advising each semester, 4) visit boisestate.edu/biology/, and 5) visit undergraduate advising information at boisestate.edu/biology/undergraduateadvising.

Department Statement
Civil engineering is critical to our modern way of life. It integrates socioeconomic, political, environmental, and technical considerations in the planning, design, and construction of infrastructure that defines our civilization.
These structures include buildings, canals, tunnels, highways, water and wastewater treatment facilities, landfills, harbors, and airports.
Civil engineers are involved in:
• Planning, designing, and constructing physical infrastructure to benefit society
• Rebuilding our nation’s deteriorating infrastructure
• Developing and implementing innovative solutions to characterize and remediate contaminated sites, water, and air
• The design of engineering treatment and disposal facilities for hazardous and solid waste and water
• Preserving and fostering sustainable development of natural resources
• Developing resilient infrastructure to limit impacts from natural hazards such as earthquakes, hurricanes, landslides, and wildfires
• Design to foster ecological restoration and rehabilitation The Civil Engineering, Secondary Education Emphasis, combines content knowledge, theories of learning and human development, study of curriculum, and methodology to help students develop the knowledge, skills and dispositions essential for success in secondary school teaching.

Civil Engineering Design
Civil engineering students gain design experience throughout their undergraduate careers at Boise State. As first years, students are introduced to the civil engineering profession and the fundamentals of design in the Civil Engineering Case Studies course and associated Civil Engineering Laboratory and civil engineering engagement courses. As second years, students take statics, fluid mechanics, coupled environmental processes, and mechanics of materials classes in which students learn to solve open-ended problems and select alternative designs. In the third year, students take introductory civil engineering courses that cover a broad range of subdisciplines within civil engineering. These courses cover environmental, geotechnical, hydrology/ hydraulics, materials, structural, and transportation engineering. Students will also take two laboratory courses, which provide hands-on experiences of fundamental concepts covered in the third-year courses. In their final year, students participate in a capstone design course in which they work on a complex, multidisciplinary project. Students interact closely with local engineers from industry and state government to prepare drawings, preliminary reports, feasibility studies, and evaluation of alternatives. Final written and oral presentations are critical elements of this course. Students are required to select two civil engineering design electives from two distinct subdisciplines, in addition to choosing further design or elective courses within their preferred subdiscipline.

Department Statement
The Department of Communication explores communication as a meaningmaking process that shapes our identities and relationships and impacts organizational, public, and media environments. Our major helps students to better understand the role of communication in relational, political, and societal issues, prepares them to make decisions that will improve their lives as individuals and as members of a democratic society, and teaches them skills sought by employers. Communication students are well-equipped for careers in public service, management, human resources, advocacy, media, education, and politics, in non-profit, for-profit, and state organizations.
Bachelor of Arts in Communication
The BA in Communication offers students theoretical and applied learning opportunities to understand, analyze, and practice communication across varied contexts. Embracing a liberal arts approach to education, students learn to be critical thinkers, creative and confident communicators, collaborative decision-makers, and engaged citizens.
Social Systems involve the interrelationships between individuals, groups, and organizations to form a coherent entity. Communication creates and connects our relational, family, work, and community lives, contributing to society as a whole. Our classes explore how communication shapes and is shaped by the various social systems at play in our lives. Students will learn about how to navigate interpersonal and professional relationships, romantic partnerships, and family dynamics (both face-to-face and virtually) in ways that will contribute to personal and relational wellness. They will also obtain skills and experiences to help them become engaged and dynamic people, teammates, and leaders, improving the ways they live and work with others. Culture, Difference, and Advocacy focuses on preparing students to be active and culturally competent citizens. Courses in this area help students understand rhetorical concepts and practices, effectively communicate across contexts and cultures, and advocate for themselves and others. The Media and Society area helps students understand and engage in today’s media environment by combining a broad liberal arts context with a critical focus on the information needs of democratic society. By studying theoretical and practical approaches to communicating in the digital age, students learn to understand the social and political contexts of mediated communication and to produce content for existing institutions and new and emerging platforms and outlets.

Department Statement
Boise State University strives to develop knowledgeable educators who integrate complex roles and dispositions in the service of diverse communities of learners. Believing that all children, adolescents, and adults can learn, educators dedicate themselves to supporting that learning. Using effective approaches that promote high levels of student achievement, educators create environments that prepare learners to be citizens who contribute to a complex world. Educators serve diverse communities of learners as reflective practitioners, scholars and artists, problem solvers, and partners.
The Department of Early and Special Education at Boise State prepares teachers at the pre-service and in-service levels to more effectively serve all students from birth through 12th grade, with special emphasis on those students with disabilities. To this end the department has three specific goals. The first of these is to enable all students who are preparing to be teachers to better understand, accept, appreciate, and meet the instructional needs of the diverse learners who are part of contemporary general education classrooms. To do this, the Early and Special Education faculty offer courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels that provide an overview of exceptionality and special education programs to all education majors.
The second goal is to offer additional coursework in Early and Special Education to students who wish to gain additional professional knowledge, skills, and expertise in Early Childhood Intervention or Special Education. The third and final goal is to prepare highly qualified early childhood interventionists and special educators who will move into specialized instructional roles in community and school settings. The Department of Early and Special Education offers four program options culminating in the BA in Early and Special Education degree. After completing the BA degree, students will also receive an institutional recommendation for teaching certification in the areas targeted in their specific degree option.
Students pursuing study in early childhood intervention or special education at the post-baccalaureate level should consult the Boise State University Graduate Catalog. The Department of Early and Special Education offers graduate program options for students who wish to pursue a graduate degree concurrently with certification as well as for students who presently hold a teaching certification and wish to pursue advanced graduate study in Early Childhood/Early Childhood Special Education or Special Education.
Bachelor of Arts Degrees in Early and Special Education Leading to State Teaching Certification
The Department of Early and Special Education offers three Bachelor of Arts degrees that result in an institutional recommendation for Idaho teaching certification in addition to the degree: a) Blended Early Childhood/Early Childhood Special Education, b) Dual Special Education, Elementary Education, and c) Special Education. Each of these degrees that leads to state teaching certification in one or more areas requires admission at two points in time during the program.

Department Statement
Economists study how people and societies decide what goods and services to produce, how to allocate resources for production, and how to divide the income created in the process. Economics courses deal with national economic health, the behavior of industries and individual firms, and the decisions made by individuals in households and families.
Economics majors who plan to enter the job market immediately after college find the degree useful in obtaining jobs in management and other areas where training in systematic thinking and empirical analysis are valued. A degree in economics is excellent preparation for law school, for MBA programs, for teaching, or for graduate work in economics or other social sciences.
Boise State offers two paths to a degree in economics: 1) a bachelor of arts that includes economics and elective courses in social sciences or mathematics (quantitative option); 2) a bachelor of business administration that includes economics and standard business courses. You must choose one path.
Admission Requirements
Students interested in pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration in Business Economics degree must be a pre-business major and complete the COBE admission requirements prior to the declaration of this major.
For details on the COBE admission requirements, see Pre-Business on page 268.

Program Notes
	All courses used toward the English degree must be passed with a grade of C- 	region, and elsewhere. Students will develop understanding of complex 
	or higher.	environmental systems, the organisms that inhabit and interact in them, and the 
social systems that structure our interactions with the environment.They will learn how to analyze and communicate scientific information, to employ data science to develop and communicate novel solutions to existing environmental challenges, and to assist with the sustainable stewardship of our economy.
Key attributes to the EnvSci program include a well-crafted core coursework structure focused on two of three natural science core course sequence options (i.e., biological sciences and/or chemistry and/or geosciences) and one social science core course sequence (i.e., economic systems or social systems or political systems), potential for certification in Data Science, a significant experiential learning requirement, career readiness training, and a flexible elective structure that will enable students to obtain additional specialized training in a field or fields of their choice. Three emphases add distinction for the degree and are tightly aligned with growth in career opportunities in environmental science. These emphases are Environmental Data Science, Applied Environmental Science, and Environmental Science Communication and Translation.
EnvSci graduates who emphasize data science will be well equipped to lead in data-driven fields. Graduates who pursue the applied environmental science emphasis receive focused training in entrepreneurship, project management, and leadership, preparing these students to be critical developers of environmentally-oriented private and public industries. EnvSci graduates emphasizing science communication and translation will practice communicating with other scientists as well as translating science to nonscientists. These skill sets are in high demand for work as professional science communicators, science policy analysts, and interpreters and implementers of science building towards best practices in private and public environmentallyoriented industries.
Experiential learning requirement: A signature attribute of the program is the experiential learning opportunities we provide to our students. We leverage our location and current expertise to build project-based and experiential learning opportunities designed to expose students to the range of environmental science careers and to develop community-based partnerships. Through these opportunities students become a key component of the network of partners that are building public, community, and market-based capacity to respond to environmental challenges. Students learn by doing and are key players in enhancing opportunities for sustainable economic development in the private 

and public sector, while simultaneously training to become the future professionals that will steward long-term sustainable interactions with our natural environments. Further, the range of experiential learning options provided through this program help build scientific efficacy in graduates, provide opportunities to build their professional networks both on and off campus, and innovate a mechanism for building on, and expanding existing collaborative relationships between Boise State and our regional community.
Acquisition of experience outside the classroom is important in the pursuit of Environmental Science careers. To gain such experience, students are required to complete a minimum of 6 credits of Experiential Learning in order to earn their BS in Environmental Science. To complete this degree requirement students may participate in research projects, either assisting faculty or developing student-initiated projects, vertically integrated project courses (i.e., VIP), or internships with government agencies, private or non-profit organizations, businesses, and other programmatically relevant professionals. These experiences can be local, regional, national, or international. Experiential learning can be an exciting intellectual journey and one that leads to a better understanding of the content and concepts gleaned from program coursework while simultaneously providing hands-on learning opportunities. The latter can often help students explore different career pathways and gain valuable skills that are directly applicable in the workplace.

Program Statement
The Bachelor of Arts degree in Environmental Studies is an interdisciplinary liberal arts degree that prepares students to explain and address environmental issues from multiple perspectives. While providing students with a basic foundation in natural and physical sciences, the degree focuses mainly on humanistic and social science theories and methods of integrating knowledge across these systems. The Environmental Studies major requires the completion of a core set of problem-based classes that train students to conduct research, integrate theory and practice, and apply knowledge to the development of solutions or recommended adaptations. The Environmental Studies major further includes a selection of classes from departments across campus that build expertise in human and natural systems. Students complete a two-credit experiential learning component that allows them to put into practice expertise earned in coursework. Majors participate in a capstone research experience that integrates team-based collaboration and problem-solving processes. Within this framework, Environmental Studies majors have the flexibility to select electives and design areas of emphasis that meet their own academic and career goals. The Environmental Studies program provides excellent preparation for law school, graduate school, or jobs in environmental organizations, nongovernmental organizations, governmental agencies, or industry.

Department Statement
The Department of Geosciences offers a suite of programs for students who want to develop skills in critical thinking, problem-solving, technical communication, and data analysis techniques by studying Earth’s processes and properties. Graduates of each program can take new knowledge and skill sets to professional careers in natural resources or environmental sciences, advanced studies in graduate school, or any future where scientific thinking is used.
Students gain a strong core of fundamental geosciences coursework as well as preparation in the physical sciences and mathematics that underpin our discipline. Beyond those fundamental courses, BS Geoscience majors choose a focused curriculum in one of our emphasis areas—geology, geophysics, hydrology, or secondary education—to better prepare for that particular career path. Five minors in these four disciplines plus Climate Studies introduce students to the essentials of each disciple, and are ideally suited to the innovative 3-D major offered by the College of Arts and Sciences where students can custom-tailor a degree plan to fit their academic interests and career aspirations by combining three minors to constitute a major.
Students not only learn current concepts and practices in Earth Science but have opportunities to generate new knowledge by working alongside accomplished faculty researchers. Research experiences, internships, and experiential learning are integral components of the learning experiences that we offer. The Geosciences, Secondary Education Emphasis combines content knowledge, theories of learning and human development, study of curriculum, and methodology to help students develop the knowledge, skills and dispositions essential for success in secondary school teaching. The program involves participation in the STEM-ED curriculum which includes early and sustained field experiences for students. Candidates who complete the Secondary Education Emphasis program have demonstrated evidence of meeting the Idaho Beginning Teacher Standards and are eligible for recommendation for state certification. Students wishing to pursue this degree plan must meet the requirements and standards for admission to teacher education, which are described fully under STEM Education STEM Teaching Certification or at boisestate.edu/educationcifs/.

Program Statement
The Global Studies major aims to prepare students as ethical, civically engaged citizens and members of a global community and workforce that increasingly demands an understanding of the complex, diverse, dynamic, and interconnected nature of today’s world. The Global Studies major will prepare students to work in a fluid global context in which people and businesses are on the move, where there are stark differences in people’s access to basic material goods, where there is increasing demand for natural resources and public spending, and where there is consistent contact among individuals and groups that hold different values and interests. In this major, students will learn the skills necessary to be responsive to a changing global environment as well as develop the skills to help lead change. Boise State’s Global Studies program offers a balanced core of courses in the humanities and social sciences. Coursework across multiple academic departments emphasizes critical thinking and provides several disciplinary frameworks for understanding global issues. The program also fosters the development of skills that are highly prized in the global workforce, such as crosscultural sensitivity, analysis of historical context, ability to work in multiple languages, and rich comparative skills. Service learning, study abroad, and internships open paths to careers in government, international organizations, law, business, education, and planning.

Department Statement
The Department of Humanities and Cultural Studies (HCS) is an interdisciplinary program that combines the study of literature in global contexts, film, rhetoric, and culture with cutting edge theory and innovative pedagogy to prepare students for a life of inquiry and a meaningful career in the twenty-first century. HCS equips students with humanities skills like critical thinking and analysis, oral and written communication, empirical and qualitative reasoning to effectively participate in, contribute to, and creatively and collaboratively respond to the grand challenges of our time.
The program’s core courses prepare students for a rounded humanities education relevant to our global present. Students also have the opportunity to take coursework across multiple disciplines, participate in internships, and specialize in one of the three emphasis areas: public humanities; literature, culture, and theory; or, rhetoric and community engagement. Compelling data from The National Humanities Alliance demonstrates the professional and personal value of studying the humanities, where students gain skills that cut across industries and prepare them for career success in a wide variety of occupations. Employers actively seek to hire graduates with good oral and written communication, problem-solving, ethical decisionmaking, and leadership skills that humanities majors learn and apply. Data collected through surveys, interviews, and research also shows that humanities majors make greater strides than most other majors in critical thinking and reasoning skills and these equip them for lifelong learning and success.
The Critical Theory Minor is an interdisciplinary program offering students a variety of critical theories and perspectives for better understanding, critiquing, and transforming contemporary social realities. The ability to think critically is a primary aim of an undergraduate education, and a critical theory minor offers a useful way for students who are exploring other fields of study to develop a background in critical ways of engaging the world. Initial courses introduce major strands of critical thought and thinkers who established a foundation for the emergence of critical theorizing. The rich diversity of elective courses provides an exemplary interdisciplinary experience with opportunities to explore the reach and influence of critical theory.

Department Statement
The Information Technology Management (ITM) and Supply Chain Management (SCM) programs prepare students for professional careers by developing key management skills including problem solving, critical thinking, analysis and interpretation of information, teamwork and communication.
The ITM and SCM programs teach a variety of technical concepts that require, or are supported by, specialized software. If you are considering the purchase of a computer or laptop, the ITM/SCM department offers some recommendations for your academic computing technology. Please visit the ITSCM department website for more information: boisestate.edu/cobe-itscm/.
Business and Economic Analytics
The Business and Economic Analytics (BEA) degree program provides its graduates with the skill set necessary to turn Big Data into actionable information that supports strategic business decision making. This unique degree program combines core business skills, data modeling, programming, statistical analysis and econometrics.
The curriculum includes courses from the College of Business and Economics along with offerings from the Department of Mathematics and from the Department of Computer Science. Business concepts are developed and integrated across a variety of disciplines using statistical analysis to identify and describe issues and opportunities. Graduates of the program are taught to view information as data scientists in order to extract data, formulate models and demonstrate the business value of the results. Business and data analysts make use of the skills to design and implement database structures, script computer language and present the results using visualizations of multidimensional data.
Information Technology Management
Information Technology Management (ITM) professionals balance human, technical, and organizational components to drive organizational productivity, efficiency, and profitability. The ITM major prepares students to design, implement, and integrate information systems and technology into organizations. ITM professionals require solid business and management knowledge and skills to complement technical skills. Such a balance between technical and management skills differentiates students as an ITM major from other technical majors such as engineering or computer science. The ITM program features hands-on, real-world, experiential learning in courses and self-directed projects with local organizations. Employers have a high demand for qualified ITM graduates and ITM careers include a wide variety of options, including business analysis, application development, systems analysis and design, database administration, information security, networking, and technology management.
Supply Chain Management
Supply Chain Management (SCM), which is the science of making things (goods and services) and delivering them to customers, is one of the fastest growing business management disciplines in terms of job opportunities and employee salaries. The career responsibilities of supply chain managers cross a broad spectrum of activities, including the purchasing of input materials and services from suppliers, the transportation and manufacturing of goods, inventory control and service operations management. The SCM major prepares students to manage these operations as well as supporting functions, such as project management, quantitative modeling, process improvement and sustainability. The SCM program emphasizes real-world experiences and applications through interactions with practitioners from local businesses and government agencies. Additionally, students are able to add depth to their study through a variety of internship opportunities.
Admission Requirements
Students interested in pursuing a degree in the College of Business and Economics (COBE), except for BS in Business and Economic Analytics, must be a pre-business major and complete the COBE admission requirements prior to the declaration of a major in a degree completion program. Admission to COBE is required before a student may enroll in most upper-division business and economics courses.

Program Statement
Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science in Interdisciplinary Studies
The Interdisciplinary Studies (IDS) program allows you to actively participate in the design of your degree. The program is known as Triple Discipline or 3D because it empowers you to combine three minors, or two minors and an eligible certificate, in order to form a major that suits your individual interests and needs. When a traditional degree path will not adequately prepare you for your academic and career goals, IDS offers a way of personalizing your plan of study. Before you are accepted into the program, you must work with the IDS advising staff to identify your program requirements, drawing from at least three academic areas. If the available options of minors and certificates do not meet your unique needs, you may discuss alternative degree paths with your advisor.
The undergraduate IDS program is housed in the College of Arts and Sciences and is available to all students. Successful admittance and completion of the program will result in either a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science in Interdisciplinary Studies. This program is not meant to be a general undergraduate degree. Instead, it will be sharply focused and designed to meet a specific, clearly defined objective.
The degree earned (BA or BS) will be determined by your selected areas of study.
Certificate in Professional Readiness
The Professional Readiness Certificate is a fully online certificate that prepares students for the workforce and supports their own reflection about the knowledge, skills, and abilities for their career. The coursework focuses on supporting student articulation of professional aspirations early in their academic exploration. The Professional Readiness certificate is an option for the Interdisciplinary Studies degree, but it is not required.

Department Statement
The Department of Management offers five majors: Entrepreneurship Management, Business Administration, Human Resource Management, International Business, and Management.
The Entrepreneurship Management major is appropriate for students who wish to start their own business, work in a family-owned business, and/or work for smaller businesses.
The Business Administration major offers students a spectrum of courses across the fundamental disciplines of business, including accounting, finance, marketing, human resources, information technology, and supply chain management. Business Administration graduates combine business, technical, and communication skills with the ability to analyze and interpret data across functions to make informed business decisions. The Bachelor of Business Administration degree prepares students for careers in a variety of areas where a broad range of functional knowledge is called for, such as: management training and leadership development programs, business analysts, sales and customer service professionals, and a variety of positions in government and non-profit organizations. The degree requirements are also flexible enough to allow students with specific career goals to create a unique profile of business-related competencies.
The Human Resource Management major provides a solid foundation for students interested in the human resource management process of a business related to strategic management, workforce planning, human resource development, compensation and benefits, employee and labor relations, and risk management.
The International Business major combines business, history, political science, and language courses to provide students with a strong interdisciplinary degree. As International Business graduates often initially enter their careers in positions requiring expertise in one or more traditional business areas (e.g., marketing, management, finance), studying an additional business or other focus area will make students more attractive to employers.
The Management major is an online degree completion program designed for working adults with some prior college experience and general understanding of basic business functions who want to enhance their careers in management. Program coursework infuses relevant business instruction with innovation and experiential learning. Through this program graduates will develop the knowledge base, analytic abilities, and interpersonal skills needed to become an effective, ethical leader, and manager.

Department Statement
Mathematics is concerned with abstraction, precision, patterns, and problemsolving and is a theoretical discipline with a wide array of applications and connections to natural and social sciences.
Majoring in Applied Mathematics or Mathematics requires a certain amount of breadth in mathematical preparation and allow a student to choose which area or areas of mathematics to study in more depth. Both require a two course sequence in an application area or a physical science. Students should give careful consideration of their application area or science sequence early in their degree program because it may affect their FN and FS requirements.
Students pursuing the BS in Applied Mathematics may choose an area of emphasis in statistics by completing 9 additional credits in designated statistics courses, none of which may count toward their major. Students who completed an area of emphasis in statistics must have a demonstrated knowledge and understanding of statistical theory, techniques and methodologies, working with real data using computational statistical software, and understanding of data analysis. An area of emphasis in statistics provides a window of job opportunities in business, government, industry and health sectors, and further studies in statistics. The Applied Mathematics BS degree cannot be earned with the Mathematics BS degree.
The Mathematics, Secondary Education Emphasis combines content knowledge, theories of learning and human development, study of curriculum, and methodology to help students develop the knowledge, skills and dispositions essential for success in secondary school teaching. The program involves participation in the STEM-ED curriculum which includes early and sustained field experiences for students. Candidates who complete the Secondary Education Emphasis program have demonstrated evidence of meeting the Idaho Beginning Teacher Standards and are usually eligible for recommendation for state certification.
Students wishing to pursue this degree plan must meet the requirements and standards for admission to teacher education, which are described fully at: boisestate.edu/education-cifs/. Students must meet and maintain all knowledge, skill, and disposition requirements to remain in the program.

CADRE—Chair and Professor: LTC Mike Kinsel. Lecturers: Bond, Cisneros, Cunningham, Donnelly, Schuler.
Program Offered
	•	Minor in Military Science
Department Statement
The objective of senior Army ROTC is to provide world-class leadership training to transform Scholar - Athlete - Leaders at Boise State University into commissioned officers, and prepare them to lead small units upon arrival to their first unit of assignment in the United States Army, Army Reserves, and Army National Guard. Over two-thirds of all U.S. Army Officers commission through Army ROTC.
Scope of Instruction
Army ROTC offers four years of military science courses at lower and upperdivision levels. Participating students who do not enroll as cadets in ROTC are ineligible to participate in leadership labs, physical fitness classes, or training exercises. The lower-division courses may be waived for qualified veterans and soldiers currently enlisted on Active Duty (Green to Gold), the Reserves, or the National Guard. Lower-division courses can also be waived for students eligible to attend Basic Camp. Students who wish to enroll as ROTC cadets must apply and be accepted by the chair of the Department of Military Science. Upper-division cadets must complete two years of military science and associated labs, field training exercises, physical training, a U.S. military history course, and a six-week Cadet Summer Training (CST). CST provides practical application of the leadership principles and theories acquired in the classroom. Upon completion of upper-division requirements, qualified cadets are commissioned as second lieutenants in the U.S. Army, Army Reserve, or Army National Guard.
Minor Admission Requirements
Boise State students enroll in military science courses by signing up during registration in the same manner as for other University classes. There is no advance application required for the lower-division courses, and enrolling in ROTC and taking military science courses incurs no military requirement. Students should contact the Department of Military Science to receive information on lab participation, physical requirements, and administrative items needed to enroll in the physical fitness class and labs. To receive the Military Science minor, a student must be admitted into and complete the upper division ROTC courses, to include labs, field training exercises, and the physical fitness course. In the upper division, these activities require that students enroll as ROTC cadets, with intent to commission into the U.S. Army. Cadets who successfully complete the upper-division courses will receive a Minor in Military Science. Prior to commissioning as officers, cadets must also meet army physical and civil conduct requirements, be U.S. citizens, and be accepted/recommended by the department’s professor of military science.
Scholarships
Two, three, and three-and-one-half year on-campus scholarship applications are available through the Military Science Department. Scholarship pays full in- or out-of-state tuition, books, and fees. Scholarship and contracted students receive an educational stipend during the school year which pays monthly to facilitate our cadets’ focus on academic performance and graduation. Upon graduation, scholarship and contracted cadets will serve as Commissioned Officers in the Army National Guard, Army Reserves, or Active Duty Army. Students may also inquire with the Department of Military Science for educational benefits available through participating in the Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP), which includes an enlistment into the Army National Guard or the Army Reserve. For more information contact the Department of Military Science at (208) 426-3500.
Uniforms
Basic and advanced course students will be provided uniforms and equipment for ROTC classes. All such items of clothing and equipment are the property of the U.S. Government and are provided solely for the purpose of providing military training for the student. Students are responsible for the safekeeping, care, and return of the property issued to them.

MUS-PRV courses carry an extra fee. For details, see Chapter 6—Tuition and Fees in this catalog.
Students enrolling in private lesson (MUS-PRV) studies must secure the consent of the instructor prior to registration.
Entering music majors will enroll initially in 100-level MUS-PRV private lesson studies; non-music majors must enroll in 100-level studies. Before permission is granted to any student to enroll in a higher level, the student must audition before a faculty jury to determine assignment to an appropriate level. Juries are held during exam week each semester. Students transferring into the Music Department as music majors from another institution or from another department within Boise State must audition for the music faculty, and the appropriate level will be determined at that time. Details in performance level requirements for each instrument and voice are available from the Music Department office. All MUS-PRV undergraduate courses may be repeated for credit (no limit).

Four-credit studies are reserved for performance emphasis majors in the bachelor of music program. Nonperformance majors may enroll for 4 credits only with permission of the instructor and the department chair. Suffix letters identify the particular instrument in each instrumental family: woodwinds: A flute, B oboe, C clarinet, D bassoon, E saxophone, F recorder; Brasses: A horn, B trumpet, C trombone, D tuba, E euphonium; Keyboard: A piano, B organ; Fretted stringed instruments; A guitar; Bowed string instruments: A violin, B viola, C cello, D string bass.

Department Statement
Philosophy involves a reasoned attempt to answer questions that arise from reflection on basic concepts and assumptions about the world and our experience of it. Some of these questions are of obvious practical importance, for example, “What is the morally right thing to do?” Others are more abstract, for example, “What is the nature of knowledge (or reality, or goodness)?” Serious philosophical inquiry into such questions is typically grounded in careful study of the efforts of earlier thinkers; thus, an important aspect of the major is the study of the history of philosophy.
The undergraduate major in philosophy develops intellectual skills useful in life, in many careers, and in other fields of advanced study, such as law, religion, and public affairs. For students who aspire to academic careers in philosophy, the major provides the basis for graduate work in the field.
The program requirements for a major in philosophy, in addition to the necessary requirements to obtain a bachelor of arts degree from Boise State University, consist of 37 hours of philosophy credit at various levels. (See “Degree Requirements”, below, for further details.) Philosophy majors should bear in mind that the university requires the completion of a total of 40 hours of upper-division credit by all graduating seniors.

Department Statement
Physics is the study of matter, motion, force, and energy—from the very small (quarks) to the very large (the universe), and every length scale in between, including the rich variety of phenomena we encounter in everyday life. Physics draws from and inspires developments in mathematics, and underlies the modern understanding (the “why”) of astronomy, chemistry, geophysics, engineering, and technology. During their studies, physics majors at Boise State University also have opportunities to do physics, by engaging in physics or astronomy research projects with faculty in the areas of nanoscience, biophysics, condensed-matter physics, and computational physics and astronomy. In addition to gaining a deeper understanding of how the world works, physics majors develop skills of observation, analysis, model-building, and problem-solving that lead to success in a broad variety of careers in industry, government, law, education, and the professions, such as law and medicine.
The Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Physics at Boise State is built around a core of physics, science, mathematics, and humanities courses that provide students with a broad and balanced foundation for additional coursework in advanced or applied physics, or for interdisciplinary emphasis areas and for employment. The following optional emphases are offered for the BS Physics degree: Applied Physics (nanomaterials), Astrophysics, Biophysics (molecular and cellular), and Secondary Education (teaching).

Pre-Law Advising
Boise State University does not prescribe a pre-law curriculum; therefore, your plan should be based on your interests and objectives in studying law. In general, as a pre-law student, you should place emphasis not only on acquiring knowledge of the fundamental elements that define the nature and character of society but also on developing methods of study, thought, and communication. Present-day law students have undergraduate degrees in business, communication, English, history, mathematics, natural science, philosophy, political science, and a host of other disciplines.
For additional information, see the current U.S. Guide to Law Schools, published annually in October and prepared by the Law School Admission Council and the Association of American Law Schools. This book includes material on the law and lawyers, pre-law preparation, application to law schools, and the study of law, along with information on most American law schools. The Boise State University Pre-Law Society also provides resources if you are considering a legal career.

Pre-Health Pathways
HSAdvising@boisestate.edu (email)
At Boise State University, the Pre-Health Pathways offers specialized advising, mentoring, and academic planning services to help you:
• Identify the pre-health track that best fits your talents and interests
• Choose the right academic major
• Complete the admission requirements you need for professional school •	Get extracurricular experience in clinical, laboratory, and research settings •	Graduate on time.
Pre-Health Pathways are designed for students who intend to apply to a professional school after graduating. Pre-Health Pathways are not degree programs. While you still need to declare a major, Pathways helps students identify opportunities and coursework to make them more competitive for professional school.
Successful preparation for a professional program depends upon timely academic advising, an effective strategy for choosing appropriate courses, and experiential learning activities. You must also adhere to the specific admission requirements of the professional school you wish to attend. Not all professional programs require a baccalaureate degree; however, having earned a baccalaureate degree typically makes candidates more competitive. Most professional schools provide flexibility in the undergraduate academic majors that you may pursue; for this reason, you are encouraged to select a degree in an area of interest. Although there is no preferred or right undergraduate major, for a list of common majors please set up an advising appointment with a Pre-Health advisor.
You may also major in non-science areas, such as English or Spanish. You must work closely with your Pre-Health Pathways advisor and major advisor to successfully and efficiently meet both the academic requirements of the major you select as well as the professional school requirements. Admission into most professional programs is highly competitive. Typical factors for admission include:
• Entrance exam scores
• Cumulative undergraduate GPA
• Science and math GPA
• Work-related or volunteer experience
In addition to strength in the natural sciences, professional schools look for candidates who demonstrate skills in critical thinking and effective communication, with exposure to social and political issues, including an awareness of the global community.
Below are suggested courses for a variety of Pre-Health Pathways. The courses listed are recommendations that are not required for degree completion unless also listed under your chosen major. While prerequisites vary by program and school, the following recommendations are based on the most common requirements of the professional schools for each field. Because the requirements for professional schools vary, the courses listed are intended only as a guideline. You are strongly encouraged to review the requirements for your school(s) of choice.
Many programs will expect you to have some knowledge of the field from direct observations through volunteering, job shadowing and other professional experiences. Pre-Health Pathways advisors will assist you in finding opportunities to work in a clinical environment and observe the practice and delivery of healthcare through arranged opportunities. If you qualify, you may register for an internship where you work and study in a clinical environment with a practicing physician, dentist, veterinarian, etc.
To register for an internship, you must have the following:
• Upper-division standing
• A cumulative GPA above 3.25
• Approval of the advisor
• Consent of the instructor

Department Statement
Respiratory care is an allied health specialty concerned with the treatment, management, control, and care of the patient’s breathing. A respiratory therapist is a specialist in the use of therapeutic and evaluation techniques in respiratory care. We are proud that both of our undergraduate degrees are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care (CoARC). The entry-to-practice respiratory care curriculum is a four-year curriculum leading to a bachelor of science degree in respiratory care. The bachelor of science degree qualifies students for the examinations of the National Board for Respiratory Care.
The department also offers an RRT to Bachelor of Science Degree Advancement Program for students who are Registered Respiratory Therapists and who have earned an academic associate of science degree in respiratory care, an associate of applied science degree in respiratory care, or an associate of health science in respiratory care from an accredited college or university other than Boise State University or the equivalent of a bachelor of science degree from an internationally accredited college or university. While the program is extremely flexible in allowing students to take their time in completing the program, it is possible to complete this program in just under a year.
Admission Requirements
• Pre-professional Year (Freshman Year) See Chapter 3—Admissions, for admission policies.
• Professional Program (Sophomore Year - Senior Year)
?	Only students who have completed or are in the process of completing the pre-professional curriculum (courses listed in the Freshman Year) with a GPA of 2.00 or higher will be considered for acceptance into the Respiratory Care Program.
?	Health status must be adequate to ensure performance of hospital activities in accordance with ADA guidelines.
To protect patients with whom students come in contact and to ensure the continued health of the student, students will be required to provide documentation of immunity and/or current immunity testing. Students entering the program will be given a list of the required documentation at the time of acceptance into the program. Documentation must be on file prior to the first day of classes each August.
All students admitted into the respiratory care program must submit to a criminal background check at their own expense. Information from the background check deemed to be detrimental to the care of patients will result in dismissal from the program. Please see the Respiratory Care Department Policies to obtain more information about this policy.
Students who are accepted into the program must provide documentation of completion of a BLS Healthcare Provider course by the first day of classes in August of the year in which students enter the professional program.

School Statement
The baccalaureate degree program in social work has been accredited by the Council on Social Work Education since 1974. A major in social work prepares students for beginning generalist, strength-based social work practice, graduate level social work education, and social work licensure.
Social work is a profession that is indispensable in contemporary society. Social workers help people cope with the stresses and challenges of everyday life.
Students are prepared to work with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities to address issues of coping and emotional support and also deal with broader challenges—such as violence and social inequality—that affect all people. Students earning a bachelor’s degree in social work practice in a variety of social welfare settings and with a variety of populations.
The School does not approve academic credit for prior work or life experience. Students accepted into the Undergraduate Social Work Program will be required to submit to multiple criminal background clearances and drug and alcohol clearances at their own expense throughout the program. Information obtained from the background clearances deemed to be detrimental to social work practice will result in dismissal from the program. More information can be found on the School of Social Work’s website, boisestate.edu/socialwork/.
The Bachelor of Arts in Social Work can also be earned at Boise State’s regional site in Twin Falls at the College of Southern Idaho.

Program Statement
The Sustainability Minor is a 22-23 credit interdisciplinary minor. The curricular focus of the Sustainability Minor is based on the premise that the most pressing societal sustainability challenges of the next century will require an integrated understanding of the social, environmental, and economic implications of the decisions that individual agents make.
The Sustainability Minor has been designed to prepare students to better understand how individuals, businesses, and organizations allocate resources, design policies, build processes, products and services, with the ultimate goal of moving toward and achieving sustainability. The long-term goal of the Sustainability Minor is to provide students with the tools that they need to positively transform the organizations and communities with whom they interact, in ways that seek to balance social, environmental, and economic needs and impacts. The minor consists of a focused core curriculum (10 credits); three sustainability-focused electives (9-10 credits) drawn from natural systems, economic and business sustainability, and societal sustainability areas; and a three-credit integrative sustainability culminating activity course, drawn from a broad list of disciplines.

Program Statement
Teacher Education in the College of Education collaborates with and supports programs all across campus that lead to an Idaho teaching credential. In order to obtain an Idaho teaching credential, students must meet certain requirements in Teacher Education (in addition to their degree requirements) that align with requirements from the Idaho State Department of Education for certification. Teacher Education collaborates closely with the State Department of Education to ensure that we stay up-to-date on these external requirements that are essential for earning a teaching credential in addition to a Boise State degree. State certification requirements are reviewed and assessed at three points in time: 1) admission to Teacher Education, 2) admission to Professional Year, and 3) application for Idaho certification. This section of the catalog will outline these requirements.
In addition to academic requirements, candidates in Teacher Education programs are responsible to uphold professional and ethical behavior in alignment with the Danielson Framework for Teaching, the Idaho Core Teaching Standards, and the 
Code of Ethics for Idaho Professional Educators (see the Idaho State Department of Education for additional information). Candidates’ professional and ethical behavior is monitored and evaluated throughout the program (see the end of this document for more information on these policies and procedures). Teacher Education degree programs across campus are grouped in one of three two groupings for the purpose of delineating requirements: Elementary Education, and Secondary Education, or STEM Education. The following table outlines which programs fit in which group (please see the department where each program is housed for more specific information about degree requirements):

Special Information for Students Pursuing Certification 
Via a Teaching Endorsement Box (e.g., English Teaching 
Endorsement or Biological Science Teaching Endorsement Minor)
All individuals seeking a teaching endorsement in a content area must complete specific education coursework, instructional methods, required Praxis exams, and supervised clinical fieldwork with a common summative assessment and professional learning plan. 
Students may pursue certification via a Teaching Endorsement box in one of two ways:
1. As part of an initial program (adding to an existing bachelor’s degree leading to teacher certification).
a. In this case, students are pursuing a primary endorsement area through their bachelor’s degree program and adding an endorsement through a teaching endorsement box (e.g., pursuing a primary endorsement area in History (6-12) and an American Government/ Political Science (6-12) endorsement through the American Government/Political Science Teaching Endorsement box. 
b. Students should follow requirements for admission to Teacher 
Education, admission to Professional Year, and Application for Idaho Certification as outlined above for degree programs (requirements for both the primary and additional endorsement areas will be reviewed through this process).
c. Students should check with Teacher Education regarding 
requirements for methods coursework.
d. Students will be required to complete supervised clinical fieldwork in EACH area that they are pursuing endorsement.
2. As a post-baccalaureate student (adding an endorsement for individuals who are already certified).
a. In this case, students already hold a valid teaching credential and are 
looking to add an additional Idaho teaching endorsement.
b. Students need to complete all coursework in the teaching 
endorsement box as well as methods coursework, supervised clinical fieldwork in the desired endorsement area and required Praxis II exams. Students must provide evidence of passing Praxis II scores before registering for supervised clinical fieldwork.
c. Students should reach out to Teacher Education (boisestate.edu/ education-teachered/meet-our-staff/) to request a certification plan, 
TEACHER EDUCATION
including all requirements for adding the endorsement.
d. When applying for certification, students should follow instructions outlined in the Application for Idaho Teaching Certification section. All requirements are the same as they are for degree-seeking students with the following exceptions that are not required for adding an endorsement to a current valid Idaho teaching certification: a) Standard Performance Assessment for Teachers, and b) the Idaho Comprehensive Literacy Assessment. 
Monitoring of Successful Progress in Program
Students in certification programs are monitored through their different programs for academics and professional and ethical behaviors. The following policy outlines this process
Teacher Education Progress in Program Policy
Guiding Framework—Supporting Academic and Professional Success: The College of Education is here to support students in their educational pursuits. Faculty should work WITH academic advisors and other faculty to support student success in proactive and effective manners. Teacher Education embraces a developmental philosophy where developmental supports are put in place to scaffold student/teacher candidate success. Performance plans are intended for scaffolded support toward success. When success is not being achieved, candidates may be counseled into other degree/professional programs.
Admission to Teacher Education After engaging in the application/interview process for Teacher Education, students will receive a letter from their program coordinator that informs them of the status of their application. Below is the list of the possible admittance outcomes: 
• Admit: a student is fully admitted to Teacher Education with no conditions left to fulfill.
• Conditional admit, academic: a student must have a 3.0 GPA and pass the required in-progress courses by the end of the current semester. If all these requirements are met, the student will then be fully admitted to Teacher Education.
• Conditional admit, dispositions: a student must work with their assigned Faculty Advocate on a plan to address the dispositional issues raised by the interview team. The student will be required to create a development plan and re-interview during the next application cycle. 
• Denial: a student is denied from Teacher Education and can re-apply during a later semester. Students have the right to appeal a denial. 
• Note: Conditional admittance to Teacher Education still allows students to register for Teacher Education courses and/or Professional Year (e.g., Internship, Student-teaching) for the following semester. 
College of Education / Teacher Education Appeals
• Appeals Procedures: See BSU Policy #3130 –for university grade appeals policy
• If a student is denied from Teacher Education, they have the right to appeal that decision.
?	Appeals go through the College of Education’s Professional Standards and Appeals Committee, which is composed of faculty members from both elementary and secondary/K-12 programs. 
	?	Appeals are due the first Friday of every month. 
?	Students must receive a denial letter before they can submit an appeal. 
?	If students are required to be cleared for adjudication purposes, they need to follow the appeal procedures. 
?	If students have exceeded the maximum repeat policy, they must appeal to continue in a College of Education major.
Adjudication Process
• For students in an early field placement an Adjudication Form is required to be submitted before you can begin your placement.
• All students must submit the form below. If you have a criminal record or a violation of the Boise State code of conduct as indicated on the form, 
TEACHER EDUCATION
you will be directed to the appeal form for criminal record or code violations.
Faculty/Staff Concerns about students
• If faculty or staff have any professional concerns regarding a student’s dispositions or behaviors related to teaching, they can complete a College of Education internal concern form. 
• The form is to be shared with the department chair/program coordinator and Boise State Teacher Education. 
• Once a student has TWO concern forms filed, they will be required to meet with their advisor, program coordinator, chair, or Assistant/ Associate Dean for Teacher Education. A student may move forward with a performance plan highlighting criteria for success at this point.
• Students must be notified if a concern form has been filed.
• You may also complete a CARE form for reporting concerns about a student’s overall well-being or access Student Outreach or Student Assistance. There are several reporting forms available to faculty and students.
Course Withdrawal and Repeat Procedures Boise State University recognizes that students may occasionally need to drop a course. Please see the University Policy policies regarding course withdrawals and repeats.
Teacher Education Program Repeat Policy: Student-Teaching may NOT be repeated.
Earning an Incomplete: University Policy
College of Education / Teacher Education
• Instructors may enter a grade of I – for incomplete – IF work has been satisfactory up to the last three weeks of the semester AND extenuating circumstances make it impossible to complete the course successfully by the end of the semester. This means field experience courses need to implement performance plans early in the semester to document satisfactory progress (opportunity)
• Faculty must create a plan with the student that clearly details what the student must complete in order to fulfill the course requirements. 
• Faculty and students agree upon an appropriate deadline for the completion of the course requirements. 
• A grade of Incomplete is excluded from GPA calculations until final grade is entered.
Professional Year (Clinical Placement) Performance Plan/Incomplete/ Withdrawal Procedures Boise State Teacher Education recognizes the stress and rigor involved in professional year clinical field experiences (internship and student-teaching). In support of student success, Boise State liaisons will design performance plans in partnership with partner school faculty and teacher candidates.
• Teacher candidates must demonstrate progress toward successful implementation of performance plan measures. An Incomplete may be issued if a candidate has extenuating circumstances that require more support for successful completion of a performance plan. 
• No more than three different performance plans across the professional year may be implemented. 
• If a teacher candidate earns an Incomplete in a clinical field experience course, the Incomplete will turn into an F once a full academic year has passed. 
• Once a teacher candidate has completed the clinical field experience where an Incomplete was issued, the faculty will change the grade. The candidate may continue at the next opportunity into the next clinical field experience (ie., student teaching) as applicable and as time permits. •	Teacher candidates may “add a semester” in such cases where an Incomplete goes beyond midterm of the following semester. They will not need to re-enroll in the field experience course or pay tuition twice for the same course (unless retaking an Internship course due to a failing grade is earned by the teacher candidate).
• Students (and faculty) may engage in due process by following the university academic appeals processes as necessary or desired.
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Boise State University must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. These laws require that the university be accessible to individuals with disabilities and, if necessary, provide reasonable and appropriate accommodations to ensure access. 
If a teacher candidate is in need of accommodations they will be recommended to consult with the Education Access Center for further information.

Department Statement
The Department of Theatre, Film, and Creative Writing serves the university and the College of Arts and Sciences as a partnership of programs focusing on the learning, practice, and interaction of the dramatic, cinematic, and literary arts. Located within the School of Arts, the department fosters the rigorous intellectual investigation of form, practice, and theory, and an active arts community through undergraduate research, professional training, experiential learning, and interdisciplinary collaboration between each of its three programs.
The Theatre program provides theoretical and practical courses in a variety of areas, all within a liberal arts-based environment. The program also produces plays and dance concerts each year that train our majors in every aspect of production. These performances challenge and educate our students throughout the university and provide cultural enrichment to the community at large. The program strives to prepare graduates to work in the entertainment industry, to study theatre or dance at the graduate level, or to achieve certification to teach drama.
The Film and Television Arts program provides theoretical and practical courses in a variety of cinematic production areas, either through a liberalarts based degree or a professionally-oriented degree. The program emphasizes experiential learning through projects such as the Narrative Television Initiative, in which majors participate in every aspect of the creation of a sequential television series, from writing the pilot to entering the finished series in national television festivals.
The Creative Writing program offers a variety of degree paths for those students seeking to pursue the study of creative writing. Each degree offers a strong foundation in traditional and contemporary letters, creative writing in the classroom, and various approaches to career goals. The degrees are designed for students seeking to prepare for careers requiring strong writing backgrounds; students seeking to develop professional portfolios in one of the specialized areas of creative non-fiction, fiction, or poetry; or students pursuing narrative writing careers with additional opportunities in writing for theatre, film, and television. The program provides a foundation in traditional and contemporary literature, creative writing classes, and opportunities to study professional editing and publishing. The Creative Writing program houses the nationally renowned Idaho Review and the Free Poetry chapbook series.

Program Statement
User experience (UX) researchers help designers understand the needs of existing and potential users of their products. The UX research program at Boise State is grounded in anthropological methods developed to understand unfamiliar human beliefs and behaviors, and convey those understandings to outsiders. It builds on a toolkit of techniques known as ethnography, centering on field visits, contextual interviews, and direct observations. The coursework emphasizes experiential learning of core methods via hands-on, practical exercises, adapted for business contexts. Students learn how those methods inform design thinking and are communicated to designers. Students develop a social media profile, expand their professional network, and evaluate their skillset in relation to current job postings in user research. In the capstone project students demonstrate their mastery of the skill-set by negotiating, planning, and executing a user research project with a stakeholder organization.

Program Statement
A Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) is an opportunity for you to work in a student team alongside a faculty member pursuing an ambitious, multisemester project that is tied to the faculty’s scholarship. As an undergraduate or graduate student from any major, you are invited to earn academic credit for your participation in hands-on research, design, and discovery related to the project. You are encouraged to participate for multiple semesters with the ability to register for 1 or 2 credits per semester at the 200, 400, and 500 level that may be repeated for up to 6 semesters. VIP opportunities are: 1) diverse— welcoming all people and all perspectives, 2) multidisciplinary—drawing students and faculty from all disciplines, 3) vertically integrated— maintaining a mix of freshman through graduate students each semester, and 4) long-term—supporting student and faculty participation for the duration of their time at Boise State.
Please note: Enrollment in a VIP course is at the discretion of the project professor(s). For more information about the enrollment process and ongoing projects, visit boisestate.edu/vip/.

Department Statement
The study of languages gives students a sound foundation in the liberal arts. Graduates with language backgrounds possess a resource for continuing intellectual growth and personal fulfillment, a passport for moving easily within the world community and its diverse cultures, and a practical tool for earning a living.
Programs in the Department of World Languages concentrate on the acquisition of language and a knowledge of the cultures that the language expresses. The department offers baccalaureate degrees in French, German, and Spanish, minors in American Sign Language, Arabic, Basque, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Latin American and Latino/a Studies, and Spanish as well as language instruction in Bosnian and Portuguese.
Special encouragement is given to students who wish to pursue a minor emphasis or a second major in a language to complement a major taken outside the department. With the changing population of the United States and the growing interdependence of the international community, career opportunities are expanding rapidly for graduates who know a second language. Second language competency has become highly desirable in teaching, government, social services, diplomacy, law, medicine, mass communications, science, technology, international trade, and marketing. The programs in world languages have the latitude and flexibility to fit nearly any career goal.
The Department of World Languages encourages students to spend time in a region whose language they are studying. Programs available through the Center for Global Engagement give students a chance to master a language and learn more about culture and customs, often while studying at foreign universities and living with local families.
Placement Exams
If you have any knowledge of French or Spanish, you must take a placement exam. Please see the world languages website for more information at: 
boisestate.edu/worldlang/learning-credit/. Placement exams do not confer credit but rather are meant to help determine at what level of language instruction a student should be placed.
For placement in Arabic, ASL, Basque, Chinese, German, Japanese, Korean or Latin, arrange for a free Placement Interview by contacting the Department of World Languages at (208) 426-3956.
World Languages Resource Center
Most 100-, 200-, and 300-level language classes include a laboratory fee to support an extensive set of enrichment activities including conversation labs with native heritage and/or advanced-level speakers. Located in the Department of World Languages in the Library, Room L-144, students have access to state-of-the art equipment in the World Languages Resource Center (WLRC). Whether taking a study break in between classes or completing a research project, the WLRC is dedicated to providing tools and services to language students. A computer lab provides access to authentic resources such as online journals and newspapers from around the world, specialized software and recording tools. The WLRC also hosts a collection of more than 1,200 films for student checkout, language books and games, along with mobile tablets for use in and out of the classroom.
Credit for Prior Learning
Credit for Prerequisite Not Taken: Students who have successfully completed a language course beyond the 101-level with a grade of C- or higher may petition to receive credit for all courses that are prerequisites to that course.
Challenge Exams: Departmentally prepared challenge exams are available for 
American Sign Language, Arabic, Basque, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Mandarin Chinese, and Spanish. External challenge exams are available for approximately 60 other languages.
Course Grades and Language Certificates
In any language course, students must earn a grade of C- or higher to satisfy the prerequisite for subsequent courses or to be counted toward a language minor or major. Certificates will only be awarded following completion of an associate or baccalaureate degree. Students who have already completed an associate or baccalaureate degree at Boise State or another institution and wish to return to pursue a stand-alone language certificate may do so.
Secondary Education
The French, German, or Spanish Secondary Education program combines content knowledge, theories of learning and human development, study of curriculum and literacy, methodology, and assessment to help students develop the knowledge, skills and dispositions essential for success in secondary school teaching. The program is grounded in the conceptual framework of the reflective practitioner and guided by American Council for Teachers of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) standards for teaching and learning a world language. Reflective practitioners adjust their teaching approaches and the learning environment to the needs and backgrounds of their students. Candidates who complete this program have demonstrated evidence of meeting the Idaho Beginning Teacher Standards and are eligible for recommendation for state certification.
Students wishing to pursue this degree must meet the requirements and standards for admission to teacher education, which are described fully under the Department of Curriculum, Instruction, and Foundational Studies or at boisestate.edu/education/. Students must apply to the Teacher Education program in the first month of the fall semester, four semesters before expected graduation. Upon acceptance into the program all students must maintain a 3.0 GPA in French, German, or Spanish courses. Students must meet all knowledge, skill, and disposition requirements to remain in the program, (for more information on these requirements see boisestate.edu/educationteachered/) and must complete and pass the Praxis II examination in all endorsement areas as well as obtain a minimum rating of Intermediate-High in oral proficiency on the Avant exam that is administered during the Senior Capstone in French, German, or Spanish. Both the Praxis II and Avant oral proficiency ratings must be obtained by the fall semester prior to graduating (during Block 2) in order for the student to complete Block 3, the student teaching semester.
Program Requirements
1. To begin the program for the BA in French, the student must demonstrate competency in French equivalent to the completion of elementary (FREN101 and FREN102) and intermediate (FREN201, 202, 203) French — 14 credit hours.
